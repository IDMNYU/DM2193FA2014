Looking at the first article, it points out many common qualities of frameworks, they are heavy, and won't necessarily work with pre-existing work. This can be said for other frameworks as well. I believe that the trade off for using a framework is having a large amount of coding already done for you, meaning that you can focus on more important things such as back end, although for smaller websites the weight of the framework can be somewhat of an issue. It also doesn't follow conventional semantic structure, and presentation and content are no longer separate. The last point (not counting the one about sass since there is now a sass version), that bootstrap makes every website that is made using it, looks similar. This is true, but that isn't always a bad thing. Having something that people easy recognize can be good, because they don't have to learn how to read and use it. 
The second article is about one of the bigger controversies (maybe thats the right word) surrounding the web - is it a web-site or a web-app? The article cites some big names in the web industry, who point out ways to differentiate: the user experience, and the architecture to name 2. My opinions fall in line with what they have to say. If a page is just meant to display static (!important) information, than it should be classified as a site, with links like wikipedia and blogs falling under that category. This leaves everything else to the app domain. Things that allow users to perform tasks that would previously be done using an installed program such as Google Drive or Gmail fall under this category. There are some pages that fall on the line such as Facebook and Youtube, which is where, in my opinion, architecture differentiates. Facebook has a deep architecture, allowing users to share posts, links, videos, polls, chat with others, and much more whereas Youtube is more or less only video sharing, with comments added in. It really does come down to the capabilties of the page, and its innate complexity.
