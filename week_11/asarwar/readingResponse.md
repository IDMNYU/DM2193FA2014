## [5 Reasons NOT to Use Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.zingdesign.com/5-reasons-not-to-use-twitter-bootstrap/)

Twitter Bootstrap could potentially create extra work as you go through the project inevitably finding and fixing weird bugs, which you could argue defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. If you do want to use all of the sweet functionality baked into Twitter Bootstrap, you should have a good think about resource loading times.
Twitter Bootstrap will help you to build an attractive, responsive website with all the bells and whistles, but some mobile users could be turned away by the slow loading time and battery-draining scripting.

Twitter Bootstrap is super-popular, and therefore every dev and his dog is going be using it.
Lack of semi-colons. A lot of bootstrappers have complained about bootstrap.

#### Bootstrap putting web designers & front-end devs out of their jobs?
This is one of the more bizarre issues; the fear that as frameworks like Bootstrap give presentation power to the web developers, the web designer/front-end developer role will become obsolete.

Bootstrap is more like scaffolding, a speedy way for devs to prototype a website or app for baseline structure or MVP. Bootstrap doesn't work with JavaScript disabled. Like most web tools these days, Bootstrap doesn't provide fallbacks for users without JS. It just means that you'll have to provide your own fallback if you do want that support.

There are plenty of good reasons why you should use Twitter Bootstrap for your web projects though. At the end of the day, time, project and audience constraints factor into whether or not to utilize Twitter Bootstrap.

## [Web Sites vs. Web Apps: What the Experts Think](http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2013/07/web-sites-vs-web-apps-what-the-experts-think/)

There remains a debate on where "Web sites" end, and "Web apps" begin.

Guest author Ciprian Borodescu presents the opinions of several prominent figures in the web technology domain and discusses the 'app-ification' of the web.
In the last few years, the web brought with it a new term that can be exciting and confusing at the same time: "Web app".

What is a "Web app", how does it differentiate from a "Web site" and why does it matter?

To figure out the boundaries between websites and web apps, I interviewed several prominent figures in the web technology domain who contributed with their experience and professionalism to help guide the debate: Dominique Hazael-Massieux, James Pearce, Michael Mullany, Christian Heilmann and Stephen Pinches.

In the pre app store era, the word "Applications" had been applied to Web sites that provided advanced user interactions and capabilities previously available only through installable software.

Compared to the classic web, i.e. blogs and news sites, web apps provided a richer user experience and access to advanced browser capabilities.
Today single-page web sites might still be referred to as web apps, but it's more about the task focus than the technology itself.

The task centricity of web apps is easier to understand if you think of smartphones or tablets: an app's purpose is to achieve a specific task, like making a call, checking your email or finding a taxi nearby.

Some may argue that we can simply classify Web sites as being read-only and Web apps as being read-write.

According to Dominique Hazael-Massieux, a Web site can be presented as a Web app as long as users consume it in a similar way they do a native app.

Facebook's James Pearce outlined a few possible vectors that need to be considered when differentiating between Web sites and Web apps.

In the case of single page webapps, is SEO the price to pay when choosing to give the browser far more autonomy and responsibility and take advantage of its HTML5 APIs like storage? Do Web sites have SEO capabilities while Web apps don't? We are back to explaining the differences between the two by using technical terms.
The creators of the competition correctly argued that "The mobile web is the most fertile ground for leading edge web development because it doesn't have the legacy of the older internet explorers that the desktop does. You can start your development with the assumption that your app or your content will be used in a fairly recent browser, so you can take advantage of a whole host of features like Canvas, inline SVG, HTML5 video, CSS3 styling etc. that bring the experience alive for the user", as Sencha's Michael Mullany explains.
