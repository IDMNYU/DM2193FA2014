### Show & Tell

This website lets me relive my childhood. I grew up on Nick cartoons and most of the time you have to go on YouTube to find low quality
versions of the cartoons. But through this website, I can procrastinate even more on my homework with some classic cartoons.

After reading this article, I feel that bootstrapping might not be the most amazing tool to use for making a website. When I was first told
about bootstrapping, I thought it was the greatest and wondered why more people didn't use bootstrapping if it was so helpful. Now I've begun
to notice that it does make websites look the same. If just the layout was similar it wouldn't be so bad, but some webpages looked almost 
copies with different colors and words. I also didn't realize that bootstrapping could put people out of jobs. I came to college in hopes of 
being able to become a professional web developer. But now seeing how easy it is to take the same concpet of another site, it worries me that 
soon making a website will take no code at all and put me out of a job.

As someone who has coded for almost 3 years now, I've learned to be able to tell the difference between a web SITE and a web APPLICATION. 
However not everyone has this ability, and this article is great for those who don't realize this difference. I feel that in the arguement
of whether you should go with building a web site versus a web application, I don't see why you shouldn't try to create both! For instance, 
once you create a web site, a web application can be a smaller version of this grand web site. You can even change up your web application to
create something more sleek and efficient than your web site, and go back to improve your web site.
