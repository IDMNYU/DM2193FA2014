### Reading Responses
* [5 Reasons not to use Twitter Bootstrap, Author](http://www.zingdesign.com/5-reasons-not-to-use-twitter-bootstrap/) --> The writer did add at the end that a lot of the problems he mentioned are no longer there because bootstrap has been updated but I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon simply because 1) it sacrifices creativity. I think if someone needed a site just for the function of being reached then that's great, use bootstrap but people don't just want the exact same site that they've seen plenty of times before. It kind of diminishes the whole idea of web "DESIGN." 2) I'd just be too lazy to update my code to accomodate Twitter Bootstrap when it's not even needed in the first place. 3) It's practically been hammered into my head that content should be separated from design and interaction and HTML so it seeing that Twitter Bootstrap doesn't follow these principles, it's perfectly understandable why others and I would be reluctant to use it.
* [Websites vs Web Apps, Ciprian Borodescu] (http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2013/07/web-sites-vs-web-apps-what-the-experts-think/) I think of all the differences that were mentioned the ones that stuck out/made the most sense to me were the technical ones because like they said, when talking about things like linkability and UX, the lines can be pretty blurry. The way I understand the differences are through things like being self-contained, using advanced device capabilities, working off-line, not relying on the browser chrome etc. On the question of building web-apps or web sites I don't think it's something people should even be talking about. Build what needs to be built and do it well. There'll always be a situation where a web app is needed and when a web site is needed. They're not mutually exclusive.
