* [5 Reasons not to use Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.zingdesign.com/5-reasons-not-to-use-twitter-bootstrap)

Interestingly, one of the author's biggest points of contention for not using Twitter bootstrap, lack of sass support, has been rectified by a new bootstrap version as noted by his update at the end of the article. That leaves us with four other reasons which I think have some merit to them. 

The first one he mentions is that it doesn't follow best practices with its overabundance of classes crammed under DOM elements. It goes against the front-end purist view that content should be independent of presentation. It's also mentioned that such methodology makes it harder for scalability, reusability, and maintenance. I don't have much of an opinion on this since I'm not seeing how any of this is true aside from the aesthetics of the code which doesn't bother me.

The second reason is that bootstrap will collide with existing html, css, and javascript which causes bugs, errors, and makes weird things happen.
This is only an issue if you are currently working on a project that is well underway and has a lot of html, css, and javascript written for it already. It's important to avoid this issue by planning ahead and deciding whether or not you want to use bootstrap at the beginning.

Third reason is that twitter bootstrap is heavy in size. Oh, what? I never noticed that because anyone with a half decent internet connection can load bootstrap up in an unnoticable amount of time. Sorry people from New Zealand, I love your grass-fed cheddar cheese but this issue doesn't bother me. 

The fourth reason of no sass support was quite a setback for anyone who wanted to use it but this has been fixed in newer bootstrap releases.

The fifth reason, one that has the most weight and the most detrimental to your website's userbase count, is that your website will look the same as everyone else's. This is a big problem. The top, most popular websites out there, google, facebook, youtube, yahoo, etc., all have their own unique look and style to them. If they couldn't be distinguished from one another by their interface and apperance then they would be easily forgettable. 

Ultimately, I would still use bootstrap despite these faults in its design simply because I could not develop a website as good of a website on my own.

* [Web Sites vs. Web Apps: What the experts think](http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2013/07/web-sites-vs-web-apps-what-the-experts-think)

Essentially what makes a web app different from a website is that you perform tasks on them. With websites it's a read-only interface and there is limited to no user interaction. However, there is some ambiguity as to whether something is a website or a web app. For example, facebook could be considered a web site because you are reading the contents on your's or other's profile but facebook has added in its own selection of apps such as games and giving virtual gifts to friends. In such a case as facebook's, there is no clear definition of what the site is as it can be treated as either. Even Facebook's James Pearce was unable to classify it in his definition of websites and webapps. In my own opinion, it depends on how the user uses the site which defines it.  For instance, I mainly use facebook as a messenger to talk to others and don't usually go around viewing profiles or writing on their walls so in my case I would call it an app. There could be someone who's only using facebook to look at other people's profiles aka "facebook stalking" in which case it would be more of a website. These are just two extremes of ways people may use facebook and there is a middle ground where one may both use it as a app and a site. 

The application of the web is definitely apparent. Again looking at facebook, there are easily dozens more apps being written for it than there are things added to it's "site" or reading functionality.
