## Midterm Project - The speed bump in the middle

    Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.
        — Jeffrey Zeldman

#### Redesign one of the above sites
You are charged with taking one of these highly trafficed sites and redesigning it. This is not a coding midterm, this is a design project.
Keep primary audience in mind. Think about how you use the sites and any frustrations you have with them. 

* How are the sites used today?
* How will they be used a year from now?
* Does the content on the site work in the format is it in now?
* Are the sites as useable as they could be?
* What are some simple changes that we could make to improve the overall experience for the people using the site?
* What are some big changes?

* Topics to think about when working on your redesign:
  * User Experience
  * Interface Design
  * Information Architecture
  * Page Heirarchy & Composition
  * Audience
  * Accessibility
  * "Above the fold"
  * Findability & Scanability
  * Responsive & Mobile First

* Deliverables
  * Checkout the [Midterm Deliverables Template Folder](./johnny)
  * Wireframes for three different views (Thurs)
    * Label sections for heirarchy and by class 
  * Designs for three different views (Next Tues)
    * Examples:
      * Craigslist Homepage
      * Craigslist List View
      * Craigslist Item View
  * Use any tools you like to produce the wireframes and designs as long as they end up in Github in .PNG format
  * Build 
    * HTML
    * CSS
  * Documentation PDF

* Critique
  * Be prepared to talk about your work in front of the class
  * Use the language and vocabulary above to describe your decision making process / design process.
