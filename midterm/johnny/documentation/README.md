## Midterm Deliverables

### Documentation

A PDF that documents the entire project.

1. Cover page
  * Your name
  * Course name
  * Overview Paragraph
    * What site did you redesign?
    * What are you changing about the site in your design?
    * How is your design better?
    * This is your opportunity to justify your decisions and reiterate things discussed during in-class critique!
2. A page per view
  * Each page contains: 
    * Final wireframe
    * Final design
    * Screenshot in browser
3. That's five pages

Adobe Indesign is a fantastic program to use to build this documentation. 
Suggest using 11x17" document size.

This is due at the end of the semester
