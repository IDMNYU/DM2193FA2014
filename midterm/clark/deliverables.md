### Show & Tell

I have way to much fun with this website. Freshman year my friends made this my homepage on my browser when I left my laptop opened and every 
once in a while we'll still post this on each other walls. The website itself is hilarious and I seems to be more challenging that some other 
video games that will go for $60 while this is free. Whenever I need to let my brain relax, this is one of my go to websites to just laugh at 
how funny the game is.

### Reading Responses

This article made me rethink how I thought about sketching. I'm not an artistic person myself and I always thought of sketching for art 
students. As I did my wireframes, I couldn't do it by hand as I had no idea where to start but thankfully moqups.com saved me and my artistic
inabilities. However, as I went through this slideshow, I noticed how none of the sketches were made perfect and clean. Although the sketches 
made sense, most of the sketches had no color to them and it was easy to be able to understand what the artist was trying to depict. The 
slideshow also went on to say that mistakes are going to be made and for the most part can be covered up. When I usually make a mistake in a 
drawing, I have to start from scratch or else the picture won't look right to me. But now I think of taking my mistakes and using them to create
a new idea for the product. It also makes me less worried about having my own work criticed, not only in this class, but in the future as having
someone not like something about your work isn't necessarily something bad but a way to improve. The most important part of my sketches and 
wireframes should be to get my point across without confusing my auidence, not to worry about what the auidence might think.
