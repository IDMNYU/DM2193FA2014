## Week 7 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[Witcher 3](http://thewitcher.com/witcher3/#home) this website has a clear heirarchy and layout for a gaming website. Witcher 3 is a classic RPG game that will be coming out next year. The website looks awesome with the game graphics. When you type thewitcher.com/witcher3, it shows you the game trailer and it looks astounding.

### Reading Response
[An argument for sketched sitemaps and wireframes/schematics](http://www.slideshare.net/pubsmith/sketching-interfaces-workshop-interactions12-dublin) was cool. Let's just say I would never be able to do anything that looks like theirs. I have no artistic ability and my "sketches" would look like their "scribbles". But the concepts themselves are actually the ones I used when I was doing the wireframes on Illustrator. It took me a while to get used to it. But it definitely made it much neater and presentable. The materials they used reminded me of my sister's architecture drawing materials. Too many sharp and precise objects that I would not be able to use.
