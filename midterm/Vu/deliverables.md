## Week 7 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[Witcher 3](http://thewitcher.com/witcher3/#home) this website has a clear heirarchy and layout for a gaming website. Witcher 3 is a classic RPG game that will be coming out next year. The website looks awesome with the game graphics. When you type thewitcher.com/witcher3, it shows you the game trailer and it looks astounding.

### Reading Response
[An argument for sketched sitemaps and wireframes/schematics](http://www.slideshare.net/pubsmith/sketching-interfaces-workshop-interactions12-dublin) was cool. Let's just say I would never be able to do anything that looks like theirs. I have no artistic ability and my "sketches" would look like their "scribbles". But the concepts themselves are actually the ones I used when I was doing the wireframes on Illustrator. It took me a while to get used to it. But it definitely made it much neater and presentable.
