			<h2>Final (Update 2)</h2>
			<p> We are slowly making progress. There's been a problem, for some reason processing chooses to load some .obj files and crashes when we try to load some others. I found another library for loading .obj files but that also chooses what to load and what not. So we are currently using both the library(ObjModel) and PShape to load our 3d images. Few other problems, the textures are not loading so it doesn't look very pretty and we need to fix the rotation for some but we're making progress slowly. We are working on the changing colors, the text right now and the buttons so updates on that soon. </p>
