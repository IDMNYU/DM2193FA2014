## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[We are visual animals](http://wearevisualanimals.com/)
We are visual animals is my show and tell. It features emerging visual artists through efortless transitioning, user interaction and pretty pictures.

### Reading Responses
* [The Unproven Path](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-unproven-path.html)
What really stood out to me was "I abandoned seven long-held principles about business and software engineering, and nothing terrible happened." So much of innovation and entrepreneurship is just getting down to it. We may make the mistake of planning for so long and trying to make sure everything is right before we begin that we never actually begin or it ceases to become what it was when we started -- a passion project. Nothing drains out passion and enthusiasm as much as weeks of organization and planning. Sometimes the best strategy is to "just do it." I absoultely agree with his conclusion.
* [Understanding Visual Organization](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?981)
The article echoes what we just learnt in my Visual Foundation class which is we have a great responsiblity as artists in determining what comes across to the seer. Our teacher was talking about how visual design is so much more than "making things pretty" and this article is just a fine example. Look at how many things we have to take into consideration! In that class, we're discussing color and patterns, and now I'm reading about visual hierarchy and relationships -- all things that come together to send a message visually. So everything is coming full cirle.
