	The fields of engineering and art are converging, and with that conversion comes a need for visual appeal in the design of websites and coded programs. Hierarchy comes into play, with larger titles going downward in the direction in which we read text. In this past homework assignment alone, the seeming lack of organization and visual appeal made me want nothing more than to format the page slightly – to center the text more, get rid of the atrocity that is Times New Roman, and to add a bit of color to the page. And though I’m not to the point of needing a “highly technical” answering forum like the second article suggests, I did spend my fair share of googling time attempting to locate the formatting codes I needed to make my *super simple* recipe page slightly more attractive for the average viewer. Coincidentally, shortly after formatting said webpage to look better, I went on the site for my town’s annual fair, which looks like it came out of the early 90s, even though it had been updated for 2014. I felt better about myself, and about the recipe page I had just submitted to github. Thank you, Bloomsburg.
