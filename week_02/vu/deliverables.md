## Week 2 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[I Waste So Much TIme](http://iwastesomuchtime.com/) is exactly what the url says.. a website to waste time on. People submit different gifs, videos, and pictures for the entertainment for others. There is 1233 pages worth of stuff to just browse and entertain yourself with while you waste time. They also made other sites such as [Dear Blank, Please Blank](http://dearblankpleaseblank.com/) and [Attack of the Cute](http://attackofthecute.com) All three pages have similar heirarchy. It can be assumed they're replicas of each other.

### Reading Response
[Luke's article](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?981) about Visual Organization and websites is pretty interesting. It kind of reminded me of this one post I saw on [Psychology of Color](http://iwastesomuchtime.com/on/?i=50311). It makes sense that visual representation has an effect on the amount of viewers and how a user interprets the page. A difference in views can be changed by a single difference: either by color, texture, shape, direction or even size. 
In [Joel's article](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-unproven-path.html) about starting Stack Overflow, it was nice to see the possibilities in making a technological venture. He strayed from conventional planning and such and yet he managed to make a very popular website. I think it thrived because of its idea. Users love having the capability of editing, showing interests and helping out one another (apparently). Joel's partner, Jeff, shows that you can only create something great when you're having fun and that's a good mentality to take in. If you're not enjoying yourself, why bother doing it?
