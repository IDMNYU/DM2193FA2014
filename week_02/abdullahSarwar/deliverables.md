[Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization by LukeW]
---
---

Visual communication can be thought of as two intertwined parts: personality, or look and feel, and visual organization.

To build effective visual hierarchies, we use visual relationships to add more or less visual weight to page elements and thereby establish a pattern of movement through the layout.

Without visual hierarchy, page elements compete for attention, and as a result, none of them win.

In a layout with an effective visual hierarchy, the distinct visual weight of each element guides viewers through the page in an informative and appropriate manner.

Meaning is created through the differences and similarities among elements and their place in the page's visual hierarchy.

Visual hierarchy does more than simply explain page elements.

Visual organization is only half of visual communication.

Users wouldn't have to search through 100 answers, some of which were clearly wrong, because the best answers would rise to the top as other members of the community voted.

Like all my other ideas, nobody around here had any time to do it, so the idea went nowhere.

Jeff liked the idea, so we decided to make it a joint venture.

I had no idea if the site would work or exactly how it might make money, and I didn't have a ton of time to put into it.

The design for Stack Overflow was mapped out in a few phone conversations, and Jeff and his friends just started banging out the code.

Jeff kept telling me, "It's going to take six to eight weeks." I knew there was no chance that would happen, given that Jeff pulled his timeline completely out of thin air, but I humored him.

The voting system worked well - you could see that the answers to a given question were getting sorted with the best at the top of the rankings.

Before I could type in the whole question, Jeff's code cleverly pointed out that someone already had asked that exact question and gotten a few answers, and the best answer had already been voted up to the top.

We're not going to need big racks of computers; it turns out that Jeff and his programmers were so good that they built a site that could serve 80,000 visitors a day using only one server that costs a few hundred bucks a month.

For his part, Jeff says he didn't want our new venture to feel "Like work" - that if Stack Overflow wasn't fun to do, he didn't want to be doing it.

[The Elements of the User Experience by Jesse James Garrett]

The user experience development process is all about ensuring that no aspect of the user's experience with your site happens without your conscious, explicit intent.

The Scope Plane The structure deﬁnes the way in which the various features and functions of the site ﬁt together.

Building from Bottom to Top These ﬁve planes-strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface- provide a conceptual framework for talking about user experience problems and the tools we use to solve them.

Each plane is dependent on the planes below it.

Even worse, when the site ﬁnally does launch, the users will hate it.

Instead, you should plan your project so that work on any plane cannot ﬁnish before work on lower planes has ﬁnished.

Requiring work on each plane to ﬁnish before work on the next can start leads to unsatisfactory results for you and your users.

One person might use "Information design" to refer to what another knows as "Information architecture." And what's the difference between "Interface design" and "Interaction design?" Is there one? Fortunately, the ﬁeld of user experience seems to be moving out of this Babel-like state.

With the advent of commercial interests on the Web, this application functionality found a wide range of uses, such as electronic commerce, community forums, and online banking, among others.

On the hypertext side, our concern is information-what information the site offers and what it means to our users.

By breaking each plane down into its component elements, we'll be able to take a closer look at how all the pieces ﬁt together to create the whole user experience.

User needs are the goals for the site that come from outside our organization-speciﬁcally from the people who will use our site.

Balanced against user needs are our own objectives for the site.

The Structure Plane The scope is given structure on the software side through interaction design, in which we deﬁne how the system behaves in response to the user.

This model, divided up into neat boxes and planes, is a convenient way to think about user experience problems.

Users don't visit Web sites to experience the joy of navigation.

In the case of our bookstore site example, we might decide that we want the users to be able to see cover images of all the books we sell.

If we can get them, will we have a way to catalog them, keep track of them, and keep them up to date? And what if we can't get photos of the book covers at all? These content questions are essential to the ultimate user experience of the site.

As the technology has advanced databases have become more widely used to drive Web sites.

We'll see what the elements on each plane have in common, what makes each one different, and how they affect each other to create the total user experience.
