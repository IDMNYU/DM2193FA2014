## Week 2 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
* [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/)
I chose this website because its full of really useful web resources. It not only gives the code resources, but live demos of what the code does. Another really cool thing is that contributers explain their inspiration for whatever they submit.

### Reading Responses
* [Wroblewski, Luke. “Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization.” LukeW Interface Designs. 2003. (21 Aug. 2008)](http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/visible_narratives.html)
* [The Unproven Path BY JOEL SPOLSKY](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-unproven-path.html)

Luke Wroblewski's article about visual organization wonderfully explains how websites visual layout actually effects how users experience it. It is crucial knowledge for any (front end) website developer to understand, because they need to express their website in a specific way so that users are able to experience it in the way intended. In his article, Joel Spolsky talks about the internal design of a website, or the back end - its functionality - and how important it is to have good code as well as people who write the good code. Together, the articles bring together the two crucial requirements for websites, its nice to look at, both on the front end, and the back end. The coolest part was that Joel talks about a website he wants to make, and in reading it you think "A website like this already exists, its stackoverflow.com" and then you realize that he made the website and its really cool.
