## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
For this week's Show & Tell, the website is http://www.dangersoffracking.com . I chose this website because it is
simple, easy to use, visually appealing, and informative. All you do is scroll down to browse through this page. As you scroll
down, water follows you and slowly changes to help illustrate the point the author is trying to convey. 
As you scroll down, the background changes to help visualize the information. As you go down, there will be
pop-ups with text that gives a few sentences of information which also appears on the top of the page as a collection
of information that you have seen so far. This collection of information is in the format of pictures of what it is related to
that doesn't take up much space, but when you hover over it, you can read the information.
Also, the colors of the website is easy on the eyes - the color scheme isn't too contradicting or similar and the colors aren't too bright.
This means that it is easy to see all the images and text on the site - unlike a dark-blue text in black background.
