## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
For this week's Show & Tell, the website is http://www.dangersoffracking.com . I chose this website because it is
simple, easy to use, visually appealing, and informative. All you do is scroll down to browse through this page. As you scroll
down, water follows you and slowly changes to help illustrate the point the author is trying to convey. 
As you scroll down, the background changes to help visualize the information. As you go down, there will be
pop-ups with text that gives a few sentences of information which also appears on the top of the page as a collection
of information that you have seen so far. This collection of information is in the format of pictures of what it is related to
that doesn't take up much space, but when you hover over it, you can read the information.
Also, the colors of the website is easy on the eyes - the color scheme isn't too contradicting or similar and the colors aren't too bright.
This means that it is easy to see all the images and text on the site - unlike a dark-blue text in black background.

### Reading Responses
For the article - Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization, http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?981 - Luke Wroblewski expresses his thoughts
on visual appearance vs efficiency. But, regarding websites, it must have both. A website must appeal to people and must also be usable and efficient. Because
of this, many front-end designers are learning back-end aspects too and vice versa. In doing so, he explains that a website being visually pleasing is more
than just eye candy - it helps users process information better. Creating a visual relationship between clusters of information can do this. Another important point is visual hierachy. 
Wroblewski then proceeds to give examples of different images and its effect on the users and where it stands on the hierachy.

For the other article, The Unproven Path - http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-unproven-path.html - Joel Spolsky starts shooting off some
ideas he has that we could use and then talks about one of his ideas that turned into reality, stackoverflow. The website was programmed by three guys and Spolisky for his
idea. It was an instant success and still very popular, but the problem was, it didn't follow his principles. He lists off his principles that he holds but then
comes to realize he was just too uptight about it in the past. All he needed was a group of smart people willing to work.
