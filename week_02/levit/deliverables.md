### Reading Response
The Unproven Path
I am an avid user of stack overflow, it's definitely one of, if not the, top site for programming questions. I love that the site was created under the pretense of having a new, useful website rather than to make tons of money. I feel that that is what makes websites work, even if eventually the creators do need to add ads or membership fees to keep the site running. Creating something must always be with the idea that a problem will be solved by the creation. This is the only way progress occurs. Something that also really humored me about the creation of stack overflow is that Spolsky never bothered to see if his partner was any good at writing code. I always find that programming is a job mostly learned during work - almost every problem you encounter is something that can be googled (or searched on stack overflow).

Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization
Visual hierarchy is something that can be an entire science on its own. Front-end programming gives the user a sense of power in moving through a site, but back-end programming is the actual source of power. While I find back-end programming more important because it allows for maneuverability and features, front-end makes the app more friendly to use. Hierarchy has the power to guide the user's eye through the page and just in size or color show importance. That's a lot of power for the programmer to develop movement in a site, which not too many can do.
