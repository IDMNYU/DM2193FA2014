        <h1>THAI GREEN CURRY</h1>

        <h2>Description of Thai Cuisine</h2>

        Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. It is known for its complex interplay of at least three and up to four or five fundamental taste senses in each dish or the overall meal: sour, sweet, salty, bitter and spicy

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

				<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
				<li>1 medium onion, cut in 8 wedges</li>
				<li>1 green bell pepper</li>
				<li>1 stalk lemongrass</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh ginger</li>
				<li>3 tablespoons Thai green curry paste</li>
				<li>2 kaffir lime leaves</li>
				<li>3 cups unsweetened coconut milk</li>
				<li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li> 
                <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breasts</li>
				<li>sea salt</li>
                <li> 1 lime, juiced</li>
                <li> basil leaves </li>
                <li> cilantro leaves </li>
                <li> thai green curry paste </li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat and coat with the oil.</h3>
<h3> JESSE, WE NEED TO COOK.</h3> <p> Saute the onion and green peppers for 3 minutes to soften. Split the piece of lemongrass down the middle and whack it with the flat side of a knife to open the flavor. Add the lemongrass, ginger, curry paste and lime leaves to the skillet and stir for 2 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk and chicken broth. Lay the chicken pieces in the mixture to poach; add a pinch of salt. Stir together and simmer over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Squeeze in the lime juice and shower with basil and cilantro; serve in dinner bowls with lime wedges. </p>

<h3> GREEN CURRY PASTE</h3> <p> 
Heat the coriander, cumin seeds, and peppercorns in a small dry skillet for 2 minutes until fragrant. Put the seeds in a clean coffee grinder or spice mill and buzz the spices to a powder.
Put the spice blend and remaining ingredients in a food processor, and pulse to combine. Pour in the water to help grind everything down into a paste.</p>
