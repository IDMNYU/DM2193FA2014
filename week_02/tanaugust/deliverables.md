Wroblewski, Luke. “Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization.” LukeW Interface Designs. 2003. (21 Aug. 2008)

This article gave me an insight into the structure of the visual architecture of a website. In general, websites should have the most basic information that is relevant to a page displayed.Then there should be navigation panels with top level labels that have drop down menus to bring you to other parts of the site. If there is information on the page that is not as relevant to what the user is searching for such as a trademark, then that bit would be shrinkened and lighter in color. Overall, I found the article to be a great outline of the visual organization of a webpage and it gave specific examples to help illustrate it's point.

Joel Spolsky manages to prove an unproven path of developing a very successful startup. He disproves his own 7 step method in his explanation of his success with stackoverflow.com. One of the things that I wished he gave more insight in was his explanation of hiring Jeff. He says, "But I entered into the joint venture agreement with Jeff after meeting him in person just once, for about three minutes, and I never bothered to check if he could write good code" as a way of explaining his unproven method. However, I was curious as to what he found in a person after meeting him for three minutes that would make him want to work with him on a startup. I'm sure it wasn't as simple as just the three minute in-person meeting but I feel that finding team members you work well with is an important process that would've been interesting to hear more about. There was another point in the article where he mentioned that Jeff and his three friends just started banging out code also sounded like a great opportunity to give insight into how a successful programmer and operates. I feel like that was another missed opportunity that would have been interesting to hear more of. His last paragraph which sums up the article, "Entrepreneurship boils down to the simple fact that a team of really smart people who can get things done are going to get smart, useful things done", made mention of the intelligence of his team but he never explained what made his team so intelligent. Perhaps all that information could be made in a follow-up article. Not trying to be too negative on the article. These were just some of my initial thoughts upon reading the article. I thought it was a great story of the atypical process that created stackoverflow that would have been better served with better insight on the individuals of the team.
