### Show & Tell
http://www.forever21.com/
My show and tell this week is seems a little boring as it is just a shopping website for a popular clothing store, mostly for young women.
However, the interface of the website is actually well made, especially to get cutomers to spend the most amount of money. The majority of the
front page, before you scroll down, is taken up by a banner for new sweaters using the phrase Sweater Weather to get more people's attention.
Even as you first visit the page, the fact that there is free shipping if you spend over $50 is tucked away in the corner, so either people 
won't look at it or so people will notice what they believe to be an amazing offer and spend even more. Even by first scrolling, there is an 
offer for 21% of selected items. By noticing this sale, you try and find clothing or other items just because you think that you'll get them at 
a better price. In fact, no matter how far you scroll you still don't find most of the sales until you dig deep in the clearance section that 
can only be found through the top banner and none of the home page advertisements.

### Reading Response

The article's main point is to show that design and development are intertwined in creating software. I agree with the article's beginning where
the author (Luke Wroblewski) says that there should be no debate over what's important, "art or engineering", but instead said that both must
coexist. Wroblewski also talk about the concept of visua communication, which I really liked as I love designing user interfaces and created an 
organized interface that is still attractive in the sense that it grabs the user's eyes. I never though about how websitestyles in had names, 
such as proximity and similarity, and how visual differences (including how large an object is on an interface) are created with such a purpose
to not just help the user, but advertise all the positive ascepts of company or project versus the negatives, such as how much a product will
cost. Even when Wroblewski continued on in his article about how a web page is designed, it really helped that he used amazon.com as an example as it truly showed visual hierarchy and how just the placements of certain buttons creates a different atmosphere.

Joel Spolsky, the author of this article, if actually a hero of mine and I didn't even know it. Spolsky is one of the founders of 
StackOverflow, the best internet forum for when you find a bug in your code that is keeping you up at night. In the article, he claims that he
made about six mistakes while creating StackOverflow, however I think that these mistakes just made his company stronger. For instance, Spolsky 
says that he made a mistake in believing that everyone should work in one office space, even though his business partner worked across the 
country from him. Anoher mistake he stated that he made was creating schedules for when software was to be finished by. Although that is a good
idea to ensure that the product will be given out in time for one's users, there needs to be plenty of time to finish the project. As his 
partner always said about "six to eight weeks", in reality it would take basically double the time for each part of the project and yet his 
partner never thought to extend the amount of time needed to complete part of a project.

At first glance I was surprised as this document appeared out of a textbook and not a website article as in the past. As I continued to read, I
actually noticed a lot of the information in the document was just taught in my Software Engineering (Senior Design 1) course. For instance, one
diagram shows how it is better to have each phase flow together instead of doing them all completely separate, the phases being strategy, scope,
structure, skeleton, and surface. Each phase is important to the user as one phase will allow them to navigate throughout the page (scope and 
skeleton phases) while anotehr phase is the interface in which the user sees (surface). I also liked how the author of this document showed how 
each phase is again split up by what the interface does versus the hypertext system, such as the structure phase as a part of interaction 
design for the interface and an information architecture for the hypertext system. As someone who loves creating interfaces and projects that 
the user will see, I love learning more about how each phase works together to function most efficiently to the user.
