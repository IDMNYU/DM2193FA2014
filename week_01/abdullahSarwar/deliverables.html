<h3>Assignment:</h3>
<h4>Show and Tell Website:</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://www.chessnyc.com/">ChessNYC</a> blasts you with information on its homepage, but the placement of all the information is in a comfortable and organized location. It has just enough visuals to keep the user interested (rolling banner, chess related art), but not too many which might cause the user to be overwhelmed. The logo of the company is the most repeated image on the website which makes it easier for the user to recognize the brand, if he or she ever sees it in real life. The website has drop down menus, rolling banners, easy-to-find contact information, and boxes around most of the main features; these features give a user comfortable layout by making the site easy to navigate.

Article: <a href="http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/">PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT</a>
<p>
This is the last article I read among the 3 that were assigned, and this article basically stated what I was thinking while reading the first two articles. 
<p>
Programmers are: Romantics with big egos.
Programmers are: Tasked with performing a task for an end user. 

End users do not care whether the code is "a work of art"... All the end user wants from the program is that it does what it is supposed to do. <p>However, when a true artist or craftsman creates something, the patron is almost always visibly thrilled with the outcome. The patron is interested in the intricate stylistic choices the artist or craftsman decided to implement.</p><p>
Standard End Users Are Not Interested.
