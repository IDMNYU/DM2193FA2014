## Week 1 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[EDW Drywall](http://edwdrywall.com/)
EDW Drywall is a website I made for my girlfriend's mother's company. This was the first website I built from scratch, and is where I obtained most of my knowledge about website development. It was my first time using Python outside of the classroom as well. In my opinion, the general design is pleasing to look at (thank you bootstrap), and is also very easy to use (again, thank you bootstrap).

### Reading Responses
Reflect on the following questions:
* The most important point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from the reading, and why.
* The most confusing points, and why they were confusing.
* How the material connects with or breaks from your prior knowledge or how it connects with your knowledge from other courses

#### Response
The article "PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT" makes a very good point in that the beauty of a written piece of software can only be truly appreciated by someone with the ability to understand what the software does, and how it goes about doing what it was written to do. Another good point is that programming as a craft does not have levels of mastery such as those found in the medical and law fields, meaning that the field of programming has a very broad range of competence. For example, a person who has an incredible talent for programming and someone who just opened a Python shell and printed a string are both just "programmers. However, "Software is a Craft" makes the point that since code is a physical thing (albeit through some kind of medium like a hard disk), it is crafted. The important part to remember is that crafting something means that that field is a craft (programs are a craft which means programming is a craft). Just because something can only be appreciated by somebody in the same field does not mean it isn't a craft. "Software Engineering: Dead?" continues the point in that creating software is a craft, separating it from other jobs such as contractors and architects. It kind of brings the whole idea full circle, explaining how programming is different from other jobs, but is a craft none the less.
