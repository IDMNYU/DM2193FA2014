###[PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT](http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/)
I don't like this article, plain and simple. It oversimplifies the art of creating a program to the point that it
sounds like the author has absolutely no programming experience themselves. He uses Visual Basic as an example of
a language allowing know-little users to drag-and-drop themselves a solution to their software needs. This is
absurd. If anything, VB's drag-and-drop style takes the DESIGN out of programming, and design is a craft on its
own, completely seperate from the act of designing a useful program or website. One must still connect the design
and create the functionality on the back end of a project, which is programming at its purest. Also, saying that
programming isn't a craft because you don't necessarily need an educational background or have to go through
a rigorous span of training strips the title of "craft" from many, many professions that are more crafts than
law or medicine. I can understand the idea that people who aren't software developers don't care how elegant a
solution is, but if I buy a nice hand-made chair, I don't give a fuck about how elegantly it was made. Does that 
make the person who crafted this chair with their own hands and wit any less of a craftsman? No. And, as such, if
I formulate a breakthrough or efficient solution to your problem, it doesn't mean shit if you know how beautiful
and unique my solution is or not. A craft is defined as an activity involving skill in which the craftsman makes
something by hand. How you obtained the skill shouldn't have any weight in your title as a craftsman.

###[Why Software Development is a Craft](http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html)
This article does a good job explaining, in a simple and detailed way, why software development is indeed a craft.
It goes to the extent of breaking down what defines a craft, and dedicating a section to explaining why software
development relies on each of these segments of craftsmanship. Though I do believe in software development as a
craft, I never considered what aspects of programming makes it a craft. I also like how the article describes the
gradual connection of the hand and the eye over time by contrasting today's instant debugging capabilities versus
the lengthy time between writing your code and running it for the first time that developers had to deal with
previously.


###[Software Engineering: Dead?](http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-engineering-dead/)
This article scared me at first until I read further and thought more deeply about what was actually being said.
At first glance, I was offended at my passion being denounced as having "come and gone." But, then it occurred to
me that the article is right.  Software ENGINEERING is relatively, for the lack of a better word, dead. That is
because engineering is based on a set of strictly followed principles. It is an exact art by definition. However,
"exact" isn't necessarily what I would call my experience in programming. I'm the lead developer for a company, and
even in that context my methods are inexact and relatively experimental. A more proper way to describe "Software
Engineering" would be "Software Evolution", in my opinion. Programming projects aren't like architectural projects.
You don't start with an exact outcome and simply put the pieces in place. I you told me about a developer who was
able to go from start to finish without any redesigning or mistakes, I would probably slap you in the face and tell
you to get real. Software evolves throughout development, and is never expected to work the first time. Each class, 
file and function can change at any time to suit new needs or repair bugs. It's interesting to me that the epiphany
that the author and his co-worker experience is the same that his article made me experience.

## Weekly Deliverables

### Overview
During each class, at least 1 commit to Github is your **Ticket to Leave**. 
The commits for the **week** should contain all of the requirements detailed below. 
Name your files [appropriately](#filenames) and place them in a folder named for the number of the week for this semester.

### Show & Tell
Each week add a link into your [deliverables.md](./deliverables.md) and include a brief description for why you chose it.
** Show & Tell Guidelines **
* a website that has clear navigation and visual hierarchy.
* a website that is well designed visually.
* a website that has an interesting use of technology.
* a link to an article or tutorial about HTML5, CSS3, mobile first, the responsive web, and other web related issues.

#### Example
[Yugop](http://yugop.com)
Yugop reminds me of 2003 when the Internet was a weird wasteland of no more than the occasional experimental burst of bright white light 
hinting of a future to come, rich with interactive design, thoughtful user experience, and relentless amounts of media information and context!

### Reading Responses
Each week before class add a reading response into your [deliverables.md](./deliverables.md)
* Include A title and link to the article
Reflect on the following questions:
* The most important point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from the reading, and why.
* The most confusing points, and why they were confusing.
* How the material connects with or breaks from your prior knowledge or how it connects with your knowledge from other courses

##### <a name="filenames"></a>Filenames
Guidelines for good file names for web development
* all lower case
* no spaces
* no punctation `!*(){}[]#@$%^&`
  * hyphens and underscores are ok
* only alphanumerics `[a-z][1-9]`
