## Weekly Deliverables

### Overview
During each class, at least 1 commit to Github is your **Ticket to Leave**. 
The commits for the **week** should contain all of the requirements detailed below. 
Name your files [appropriately](#filenames) and place them in a folder named for the number of the week for this semester.

### Show & Tell
Each week add a link into your [deliverables.md](./deliverables.md) and include a brief description for why you chose it.
** Show & Tell Guidelines **
* a website that has clear navigation and visual hierarchy.
* a website that is well designed visually.
* a website that has an interesting use of technology.
* a link to an article or tutorial about HTML5, CSS3, mobile first, the responsive web, and other web related issues.

#### Example
[Yugop](http://yugop.com)
Yugop reminds me of 2003 when the Internet was a weird wasteland of no more than the occasional experimental burst of bright white light 
hinting of a future to come, rich with interactive design, thoughtful user experience, and relentless amounts of media information and context!

### Reading Response
Each week before class add a reading response into your [deliverables.md](./deliverables.md)
* Include A title and link to the article
Reflect on the following questions:
* The most important point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from the reading, and why.
* The most confusing points, and why they were confusing.
* How the material connects with or breaks from your prior knowledge or how it connects with your knowledge from other courses

##### <a name="filenames"></a>Filenames
Guidelines for good file names for web development
* all lower case
* no spaces
* no punctation `!*(){}[]#@$%^&`
  * hyphens and underscores are ok
* only alphanumerics `[a-z][1-9]`
