### Show & Tell
[Wavepot](http://wavepot.com/) is an excellent example of modern browser capabilities.  I can still remember how limited web development was when I first discovered it-- around age 6 through Netscape Composer on a 50 MHz laptop that I shamelessly pilfered from my Dad's office.  The fact that it's now possible to do realtime audio synthesis in a web browser illustrates how far client-side scripting technologies have come.

### Reading Response

I've observed debates like these with coworkers for a while now.  To be honest, I find them relatively frustrating-- each side of the argument tries to undermine the legitimacy of the other.  The reality is that building good software requires the union of numerous disciplines, teamwork, and a delicate balance between art and well-executed engineering.  It seems to me that the hyperbolic, often pious assertions made by modern software developers (often in the startup community) only exist to artificially inflate the perceived difficulty of the tasks involved.
