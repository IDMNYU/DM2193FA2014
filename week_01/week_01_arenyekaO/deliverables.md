# Show & Tell


[Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com/) isn't a site that provides tons of information but the designer does a pretty good job of organizing what information they have in a way that's both simple and visually appealing. There are three sections. The first section has a really nice greenish color which goes excellently with the white font BUT THEN WAIT! As you scroll down to see the other sections, the background color changes! As you scrool down to the last section, I think the color changes about 9 times --I'm not too sure because at times the changes are extremely subtle which makes you appreciate it more. You never know at what time you'll be transported into another dimension of color. I think it's really cool. 
[The User is Drunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2CbbBLVaPk) : talks about how interface usually mirrors/echoes real life you know like the arrow keys that look like the buttons you press when you want to wait for an elevator. Helps explain I guess why some design just works -- because we have met it before...somewhere in the "real" world.

## Response(s)
* While the author makes quite a case for code as a craft, from my reading I came up with the conclusion that like many other pursuits -- it's what you make it. Code is a physical thing, yes. We write it with our hands and are as very much involved in its conception as say the claymaker who molds, touches, shapes his/her clay. However, I do think there needs to be a degree of creative freedom for code to be labelled as a craft. It is because of this that I say code could be a craft or it could not.. When writing code for software for a finance company, the coder would stress exoediency --would want the project done as quickly and inexpensively as possible.He/she is not following her requirements essentially doing as they please but writing with a consumer in mind. That emphasis on the practical instead of the process of creating is what I believe shows coding is not a craft... most times. However, when we code as a crative/personal pursuit, then I believe it could be called craftmanship -- when the focus is on the act of creating and design.
* It comes back to or reminds me of my Intro to Computer Science class where he mentions (before assigning a homework assignment where we make a game) that most programmers are not creative. In previous classes when talking in general about code, he would stress functionality and conciseness: "If you can write it in 2 lines instead of 5, great!" At the onset of my class, when we focused more on making practical applications such as a currency converter, tax calculator e.t.c, the focus while coding was on the end product rather than the experience of building and writing and debugging.
* I actually understood the three articles quite clearly. So no confusion here!
