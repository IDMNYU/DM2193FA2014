### Show & Tell
http://www2.warnerbros.com/spacejam/movie/jam.htm
My show and tell this week is to the homepage for Space Jam, the movie where Michael Jordan and the Looney Tune cast save their world from 
aliens. Not only was this my favorite movie as a child, but this was one of the first websites that were interactive for a movie. The site
is still up and gives a look into how most websites looked before gifs were a big idea and having videos on homepages of websites for films.

### Reading Response
In the article written by North, he goes on to say "It would be great if programming were a proper profession, but it isnâ€™t". 
Personally this bothers me as being a programmer is what I want to do for a living but also writers Bradbury and Atwood would disagree with him 
as well. North uses an example of having a plumber go on about the beauty of plumbing and how all should see the craft in it. First off, 
plumbing and programming are two different occupations that create two very different things. A plumber can make your bathroom work where as a 
programmer can create anything from a video game to a bank system. Programming is a craft as you are creating something that you can use and 
appreciate. Those who disagree just don't fully understand how programmers work and what they can really do.
