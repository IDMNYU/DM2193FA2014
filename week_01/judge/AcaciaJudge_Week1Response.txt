	In the past, I’ve taken software and coding in all its forms for<br> granted. I knew coding and software were complex, physical<br> things, but never truly understood what they meant. In the past, <br>in art school at Tisch, we were taught to use premade <br>programs for designing and orchestrating artistic work of our own.<br> Now that I’m in IDM, I’m realizing that I never bothered to <br>learn the most basic things that went into the artistic <br>projects I’ve made in the past. I believe that to understand and <br>advance in the field of media design, that I personally will <br>need to begin at the most basic forms of computer design to <br>have a complete working knowledge of the industry I hope to one<br> day pursue a career in. I agree—coding and software design<br> are craftsmanship just in the way that filmmaking craft, but<br> software engineering is at the most basic level. Engineers are <br>the base of the programs and systems that are used by artists<br> worldwide, and they directly influence finished projects in that<br> they design the core structures of all software. While the<br> industry might be changing and become more and more complex as <br>time goes by, I disagree with the idea that software <br>engineering as we used to know it is dead. It simply is changing <br>forms, just as all technology does over time.<br>
