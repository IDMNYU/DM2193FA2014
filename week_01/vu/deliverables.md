## Week 1 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[Behance](http://www/behance.net) is an online portfolio website. It was a website I used for inspiration and ideas when I started the Samsung TV app (still in progress), my first UI project. My manager recommended this site because there's an abundance of UI designs and ideas. Most of them were pretty cool and eye catching. For example, this one: [SJQHUB](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11730107/SJQHUB-Visual-Data-UI-Dashboard). It's just interesting to see the range of possibilities when it comes to designing a UI. 

### Reading Response
First off, let me just say that the word 'craft' needs to be defined. I found it kind of frustrating when I was reading [Programming is NOT a Craft](http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/) and [Software Engineering: Dead?](http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-engineering-dead/). As Jeff Atwood stated in the article "Software Engineering: Dead?", there are many details when it comes to programming: the type, size, audience, and the applications of a language. On the other hand, I do agree that some people code for the sake of getting things done rather than enhancing the craft. You see, a craft is something that can be enhanced and learned. In my opinion, it can be improved. You can always learn something new. For instance, Apple is making a new language, swift. Sure the theories are still the same, but it's a new language, just like a verbal language, it needs to be learned and practiced. And, the creativity in coding is how you apply the code. In one of my coding classes, the professor said that no two codes should be the same. You may end up having the same result but the names and the functions could be completely different. Also, like all TV shows tell you about hackers: they have a signature, a way of coding that can be distinguished from others, like any other crafstman, thus making coding a CRAFT.
