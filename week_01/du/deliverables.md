## Weekly Deliverables

### Overview
During each class, at least 1 commit to Github is your **Ticket to Leave**. 
The commits for the **week** should contain all of the requirements detailed below. 
Name your files [appropriately](#filenames) and place them in a folder named for the number of the week for this semester.

### Show & Tell
Each week add a link into your [deliverables.md](./deliverables.md) and include a brief description for why you chose it.
** Show & Tell Guidelines **
* a website that has clear navigation and visual hierarchy.
* a website that is well designed visually.
* a website that has an interesting use of technology.
* a link to an article or tutorial about HTML5, CSS3, mobile first, the responsive web, and other web related issues.

HOME WORK SHOW N TELL!!!!!

http://www.3plus1bedrooms.com/booking/#   
It is a website of a hotel. I choosed it because it is simple, clear links to each pages, and it has a built in program for booking
It has galleries, and pages of introduction. simple and easy to use, but works great as a small hotel website. 
But although it is so simple, things never works. I have no idea how they build a simple and unstable web. 




#### Example
[Yugop](http://yugop.com)
Yugop reminds me of 2003 when the Internet was a weird wasteland of no more than the occasional experimental burst of bright white light 
hinting of a future to come, rich with interactive design, thoughtful user experience, and relentless amounts of media information and context!

### Reading Response
Each week before class add a reading response into your [deliverables.md](./deliverables.md)
* Include A title and link to the article
Reflect on the following questions:
* The most important point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from the reading, and why.
* The most confusing points, and why they were confusing.
* How the material connects with or breaks from your prior knowledge or how it connects with your knowledge from other courses

The article talks about something thats related to the two we read. First is connetion. we now using web to connect everything together.
When we have so much things, we need special people, thats how the article says, in the one I am reading, it saying that in the future the website will be more open. I guess something similar to Wiki or Github where we can let people work together instead of specialist. 
At the same time we have a risk, some of the tool or language we will use wil lmake this no longer works for speicalist anymore so ---
we can all use it. But professionals also means rules and limitation, we set things in a same formate, but when everyone without learn 
to follow the rule is impossible.
