### Show & Tell
My Show & Tell of the week is http://www.reddit.com/ . The website is visually appealing. It is stylish and simple at the same time.
Even though it is simple, the website has a lot to offer with over 20+ posts each page, links to subreddits - a part of reddit dedicated
to specific subjects like cats or math. There's also a search for subreddits and a search for content on reddit. The best thing is that
Reddit has minimal advertisements and the advertisements are not annoying at all. They are placed on the side so that it won't bother you
while looking through the threads/posts. There are no pop-ups either. This makes browsing through Reddit much more enjoyable compared to 
other sites that have intrusive pop-ups or advertisements. 


### Reading Response
In this week's article, Why Software Development is a Craft - http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html , Doug Bradley states why
he thinks software development is a craft, not engineering. The point he makes that it is not engineering because developers do more than just
design was interesting. He backs this up by stating similarities between software development and craftsmanship. This was interesting because I have never thought 
about it that way before. The article was about software development which is what I'm studying right now so it's related to my career. 

For the other article, Programming is not a Craft - http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/ , Dan North states why he thinks software development is not a real
profession because it lacks ranks. I think this is false because there are software developers, senior developers, etc. He makes another argument that software
development is not a craft and does not require a movement - Manifesto of Software Craftsmanship. He also says that software does not need to be visually appealing 
and should not be focused on appearances as long as it does its job and move data around efficiently. He points out that for software development, age doesn't matter 
and there isn't a real skill in programming. At first it was confusing when he was talking about software development not being a real profession and then talking about
craftsmanship; I didn't see the connection between the two at first.

For the last article, Software Engineering: Dead - http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-engineering-dead , the author says that Tom DeMacro claims that software engineering
is dead and his reaction towards that statement. He then agrees with DeMacro saying that he has felt that way for years, but just needed a confirmation. By coming to the conclusion
that software engineering is dead, he believes that software development is a craftmanship. This was something I have never thought about before so this idea is new to me. There were no
confusing points in this article.
