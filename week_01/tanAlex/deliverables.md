### Show & Tell
My Show & Tell of the week is http://www.reddit.com/ . The website is visually appealing. It is stylish and simple at the same time.
Even though it is simple, the website has a lot to offer with over 20+ posts each page, links to subreddits - a part of reddit dedicated
to specific subjects like cats or math. There's also a search for subreddits and a search for content on reddit. The best thing is that
Reddit has minimal advertisements and the advertisements are not annoying at all. They are placed on the side so that it won't bother you
while looking through the threads/posts. There are no pop-ups either. This makes browsing through Reddit much more enjoyable compared to 
other sites that have intrusive pop-ups or advertisements. 


### Reading Response
In this week's article, http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html , Doug Bradley states why
he thinks software development is a craft, not engineering. The point he makes that it is not engineering because developers do more than just
design was interesting. He backs this up by stating similarities between software development and craftsmanship. This was interesting because I have never thought 
about it that way before. The article was about software development which is what I'm studying right now so it's related to my career.
