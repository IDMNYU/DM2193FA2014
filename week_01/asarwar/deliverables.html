	<h3>Assignment:</h3>
	<h4>Show and Tell Website:</h4>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.chessnyc.com/">ChessNYC</a> blasts you with information on its homepage, but the placement of all the information is in a comfortable and organized location. It has just enough visuals to keep the user interested (rolling banner, chess related art), but not too many which might cause the user to be overwhelmed. The logo of the company is the most repeated image on the website which makes it easier for the user to recognize the brand, if he or she ever sees it in real life. The website has drop down menus, rolling banners, easy-to-find contact information, and boxes around most of the main features; these features give a user comfortable layout by making the site easy to navigate.

	1st Article: <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html">Why Software Development is a Craft</a> by Doug Bradbury
	<p>
		The author's evidence for Software Engineering to be considered a craft is because of similar generic practices in craftsmanship and Software Engineering:
		<li>Making: Crafter does most of the work; programmer does most of the work.</li>
		<li>Material: Better material allows the crafter to make more intricate art; Access to high level programming language allows programmers to create more powerful programs.</li>
		<li>Tools: Crafting tools; IDEs, compilers, etc</li>
		<li>Learning: Next project is always better than the last, but worse than the future project. Constantly learning new things about your trade. </li>

		A new thing I learned from this article was that the Software Craftsmanship crowd is gaining traction. 
		<p>
			<h4>My thoughts:</h4> <li>Everything is a craft when looked at in the particular angle the author presented, even walking down the street.</li>
			<li>
				You can't teach someone to paint like DaVinci, but you can teach someone to code like John Sterling. Craftsmanship shouldn't be able to be learned. 
			</li>

	2nd Article: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-engineering-dead/">Software Engineering: Dead?</a> by Jeff Atwood
	<p>
		Shaping the future of a software depends on the ability of the programmer and that ability is only harnessed through relentless practice. However, we have been seeing musical prodigies who are younger than 5 years old for centuries...

	3rd Article: <a href="http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/">Programming is Not a Craft</a> by Dan North
	<p>
		This is the last article I read among the 3 that were assigned, and this article basically stated what I was thinking while reading the first two articles. 
		<p>
			Programmers are: Romantics with big egos.
			Programmers are: Tasked with performing a task for an end user. 

			End users do not care whether the code is "a work of art"... All the end user wants from the program is that it does what it is supposed to do. <p>However, when a true artist or craftsman creates something, the patron is almost always visibly thrilled with the outcome. The patron is interested in the intricate stylistic choices the artist or craftsman decided to implement.</p><p>
			<b>Standard End Users Are Not Interested.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This line from the author confused me a little:
			<blockquote cite="http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/">
				"What makes it a craft is the work above and beyond its basic utility to give it intrinsic, aesthetic beauty."
			</blockquote>
			It confused me because so far, the author was going at a steady pace and covering all the logical points, but with that quote, he presents his opinion as if it's a dictionary definition.
		</p>
		<p>
			My experience working as an IT System Admin has taught be that whatever the CFO wants, goes. My CFO does not care if the SQL code running a office database looks good, all he cares about is if the database is up and running for the appropriate users. As a programmer, if I were to miss the database deadline because I was busy making my code stylistic and beautiful instead of functional, I wouldn't expect to keep my job. <p>Sure, I'd be a software craftsman, but I'd also be unemployed.</p>
