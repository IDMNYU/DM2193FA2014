### Reading Responses
	I think that all three of the articles put forth a good point, whether it be for or against the notion of programming as a "craft.''
	I tend to lean on the side of Dan North when he says that "programming is not a craft" because of the examples that he lists.
	The most efficient and successful programmers should only be concerned about the explicit functions of the code that they write and not over-romanticize the "the intimate connection between the hand and the eye."
