### Reading Response
Programming is a Craft

Programming may not be the most "proper" profession, but it remains one of the most sought after majors and professions out there. It is a career that allows for complete creative control. Programmers can choose any language to master and can create applications and software on their own or working for companies. A lot of what makes a job in the programming field so desirable also makes it difficult. To create a truly successful product (at least in my opinion), a programmer needs to be able to write seamless code, which can take years to perfect. Applications become truly useful when the user-end is pleasant for the buyer, and when the code can be integrated into other applications for other programmers. This takes a lot of skill. Yes, confusing code may still be read by compilers, and it may run just fine, but clear and well-written code makes the application timeless. Bits of this code may be reused for decades to come, but only for the most well-crafted of code. Applications are an art form, and programmers are their crafters.
