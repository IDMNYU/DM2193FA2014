	In the past, I’ve taken software and coding in all its forms for granted. I knew coding and software were complex, physical things, but never truly understood what they meant. In the past, in art school at Tisch, we were taught to use premade programs for designing and orchestrating artistic work of our own. Now that I’m in IDM, I’m realizing that I never bothered to learn the most basic things that went into the artistic projects I’ve made in the past. I believe that to understand and advance in the field of media design, that I personally will need to begin at the most basic forms of computer design to have a complete working knowledge of the industry I hope to one day pursue a career in. I agree—coding and software design are craftsmanship just in the way that filmmaking craft, but software engineering is at the most basic level. Engineers are the base of the programs and systems that are used by artists worldwide, and they directly influence finished projects in that they design the core structures of all software. While the industry might be changing and become more and more complex as time goes by, I disagree with the idea that software engineering as we used to know it is dead. It simply is changing forms, just as all technology does over time.
