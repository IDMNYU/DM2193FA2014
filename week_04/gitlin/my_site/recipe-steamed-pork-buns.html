                	<h3 class="instruction-heading normal">For the filling:</h3>
        			<ol class="instructions">
        				<li>Put the rack of spareribs into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in the hoisin sauce, close the bag and toss gently to coat. Put the bag into a bowl and marinate the ribs in the refrigerator for 3 hours or up to overnight.</li>
        				<li>Preheat the oven to 300&#176; F.</li>
        				<li>Put the ribs into a sheet pan along with all the marinade. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, slide it into the oven and bake until the meat easily separates from the bone, about 2 hours. Baste them every 30 minutes during the cooking process. Remove the ribs from the oven and let them rest.</li>
        				<li>When cool enough to handle, pull the rib meat from the bones and coarsely chop. Then, in a large bowl, toss the pork together with the cabbage and scallions. If the mixture seems too dry, add in a bit more hoisin sauce.</li>
        			</ol>
        			<h3 class="instruction-heading normal">For the assembly:</h3>
        			<ol class="instructions">
        				<li>To form the buns, remove the dough from the bowl and roll it into 1 long rope. Cut the rope into 12 equal portions. Roll each piece and set them aside in a bowl. Using a rolling pin, flatten each ball into 4-inch circles, leaving the center slightly thicker then its edges. Put a heaping tablespoon of the filling into the center of each disk and pinch the tops closed to seal.</li>
        				<li>Arrange the buns on a parchment lined sheet tray and cover them with a clean kitchen towel. Alternatively, place the buns into a large 3-level bamboo steamer lined with parchment paper, 4 buns per level. Allow the buns to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        				<li>In the meantime, fill a bamboo or stainless steel steamer with water and bring it to a boil. Cut 12 (4-inch) rounds from some parchment paper. When ready to cook, place the buns on the parchment rounds and into the steamer.</li>
        				<br/>
        				<strong>Chef's Note: Do not overcrowd your steamer. Steam the buns in batches if necessary. Steam for 12 to 15 minutes, then remove the buns from the heat and serve them warm.</strong>
