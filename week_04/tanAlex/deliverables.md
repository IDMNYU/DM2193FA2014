### Show & Tell
<!-- * [Name](http://link-to-cool-thing) -->
For this week's show & tell, I have chosen weavesilk.com. Weaveskilk allows the user to create symmetrical drawings in different colors. The design is very simple, with a black background, controls, and more information about the website. It isn't hard to get started as it takes you into the action right away. The website uses the html5 element, canvas, to draw. Canvas uses javascript to draw. The website uses javascript to determine when to draw - when the left click is held down.The website does not use WebGL.
