				<h2>Ingredients </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
					<li>1 (14 oz.) can artichoke hearts</li>
					<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
					<li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
					<li>5 cups vegetable broth </li>
					<li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
					<li>12 oz. fettuccine</li>
					<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
					<li>½ tsp dried thyme</li>
					<li>freshly cracked pepper (15-20 cranks)</li>
					<li>4 oz. frozen cut spinach</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><p>
						Rinse the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris. Slice the mushrooms thinly. Drain the can of artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into bite-sized pieces. Thinly slice the onion and garlic (you can mince the garlic if you don't want large slices).
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Place the vegetable broth, olive oil, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, onions, and garlic in a large pot. Break the fettuccine in half and add it to the pot along with the oregano, thyme, and some freshly cracked pepper. Push the ingredients down under the broth as much as possible. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a rolling boil over high heat.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						As soon as it reaches a boil, stir the pot to evenly distribute the ingredients and prevent the pasta from sticking. Turn the heat down to low so that the pot is just simmering. Allow the pot to simmer, with the lid on, for 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Give the pot a stir every few minutes to prevent the pasta from sticking.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Once the pasta is cooked through, add the frozen spinach. Allow the heat from the pasta to thaw the spinach. Stir the pot to help break up the clumps of spinach as they melt. Serve hot.
					</p></li>

				<h2>Ingredients </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
					<li>5 cloves garlic, smashed and chopped</li>
					<li>1.5 lbs chicken breast, cut into small chunks</li>
					<li>2 large roasted red peppers, sliced into thin strips</li>
					<li>6 hot cherry peppers, chopped and deseeded</li>
					<li>1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
					<li>1 cup cooking sherry or white wine</li>
					<li>1 cup water</li>
					<li>1 lb Rigatoni</li>
					<li>1 cup pecorino romano or parmesan cheese</li>
					<li>½ stick butter</li>
					<li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
					<li>2 teaspoons fresh basil</li>
					<li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><p>
						In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add in the garlic and chicken. Sauté the chicken until it is just browned on the outside but not cooked through.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Stir in the roasted red peppers and hot cherry peppers, and sauté for a minute. Add in the crushed tomatoes and sherry or wine. Add in the water and pasta and bring to a low boil. (If there isn't enough liquid, add a bit more water.) Continue to cook, stirring often, until the pasta has cooked to al dente, about 15-20 minutes.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Reduce to low heat and add in the butter, basil, and salt. When the butter completely melts into the pasta, add in the cream and cheese. Let simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Top with additional cheese, basil, and red pepper flakes if you really like a lot of heat!
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Serve warm.
