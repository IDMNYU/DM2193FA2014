    * Exact the contents and *copy* into a folder in your `week_04/your_name` directory

      * "My initial commit for single page recipe site"
      * Sync with Github
    * Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the markup and class names
      * Styling things goes faster when you know how the markup is put together!
    * We are going to style the recipes to look like cards and you can flip between them
    * This will be the basis of our introduction to Javascript for next class so be sharp!
    * Open up the empty stylesheet and take it away!
    * Thanks De :)
