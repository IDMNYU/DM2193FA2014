I LOVE LOVE LOVE the design of this website. And it makes me wanna work there. I literally just reopened it just to scroll up and down over and over again. It's so beautiful :')


### Reading Responses

•	The most important point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from the reading, and why.
o	Visible Narratives 
•	Wroblewski is talking about what makes a website visually organized according to placement of its functions and sections, etc. While the audience and the topic of the specific website are taken into account, there are general rules that one must follow in order to make sure the website is clear and involves a flow of information that is understandable. This also involves a hierarchy of sections in which the most important thing should be the first thing one sees. 
o	The Unproven Path 
•	One of the creators of Stackoverflow talks about how he and his two friends created the website by breaking the list of rules he originally had for any entrepreneur. 
•	The most confusing points, and why they were confusing.
o	Visible Narratives
•	I was a little confused about the emphasis on objects being separated in order for one to distinguish them. I do also believe in a consistency and similarity when it comes to adding objects to websites so not sure quite what he means by separate other than making it clear that buttons for example take you to different places in the website. 
o	Wasn’t confused about the Stackoverflow article
•	How the material connects with or breaks from your prior knowledge or how it connects with your knowledge from other courses
o	Once again, I never really thought about websites as making sure everything was separate and he definitely puts great emphasis into this concept. 
o	Creating a website is definitely comparable to creating any business of some sort.
