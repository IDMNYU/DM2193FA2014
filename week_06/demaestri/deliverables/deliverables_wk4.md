WEEK 4 DELIVERABLES: 


## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell

http://www.codeandtheory.com/

This is the second time I have a creative agency's official website as my show and tell because 
I want to be able to accomplish exactly what they are with their website: selling their brand. 
Also, any website that makes cool things appear when you scroll are the best. I'd love my website to have this
kind of thing to it too!!!

### Reading Responses

Reading: Following a Web Design Process

This was extremely helpful. I will definitely be looking back at this when creating both my website for the class
and any other creative project (whether for me or a client, which I will hopefully be doing in the near future!).
I'd like to see what other web designers and creatives would think about this process and how they might do things
differently according to their personality and work habits. But as I am someone who procrastinates quite a bit and 
lives of to-do lists, I feel like this process would definitely work with me. I guess we'll see!
