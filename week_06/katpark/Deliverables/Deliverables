Reading Response:

The article about Classical Inheritance was a bit difficult to understand. I think my lack of background knowledge in programming made it more difficult for me to fully grasp the concept of the article. I felt as though I had to continuously search terms which led to more terms in order to piece together what the author was saying. However, I appreciate his reference to java's "extend" and "super" method in order to differentiate/compare how javascript's classical inheritance works.
