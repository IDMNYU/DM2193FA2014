### Show & Tell
http://www.rainymood.com/
This is my show and tell because it is one of my most useful tools for insomnia. I don't know if it's just within my family, but everytime it rains, all we want to do is stay in bed all day. I've managed to sleep for extra hours just by listening to the sound of rain. Whenever I get anxiety, worry over a test, or just can't sleep in general, I play this and go right to sleep. 

### Reading Responses
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/99251/how-prototypal-inheritance-is-practically-different-from-classical-inheritance

In contrast to the long article that was posted on the github, this article is a stackoverflow for computer science theorems. The most 
popular answer gave the main difference between classical and prototypal inheritance, in which prototypal inheritance children gains both 
behavior and state from the parent; meanwhile classical children only gain the parent's behavior. Each answer given gives a unique outlook
to classical and prototypal inheritance compared to one article that will only give one point of view on the matter. That is why I think that
this website is helpful for learning the basics of classical vs prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
