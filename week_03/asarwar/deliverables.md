### Following A Web Design Process by Luke Reimer ###

Following a detailed website design and development process can speed up your work and help your client understand your role in the project. Even if the client has carefully planned his or her website, don't be afraid to offer useful suggestions from your experience. Using information gathered from the client in the planning phase, begin designing the layout using a wireframe. Get the client to sign off on the last checks, provide your contact information for support, and officially close the project. Your version will be modified according to your client base and style of designing. The differences between the two should be intrinsically clear: yours would be much more detailed and contain technical resources to help with development; the client's would be a concise, non-technical map of the process from start to finish. 

You could establish a standard document format and folder structure for all of your clients, or maintain a list or archive of previous clients and project files. Having an organized and concise process on hand can help organize a client's thoughts and put their mind at ease, not to mention help them understand where their money is going. Outlining my basic process as a freelancer is by far the most common first step I take with potential or new clients. Although your process will be useful when you first engage a client in the planning discussion, be sure to review it before the discussion takes place to ensure it fits the project.

### How to Read a Wireframe ###

Whether a client, stakeholder, or new to the wireframe world, here's a quick rundown of how to make sense of it all. 

* Visual Vocabs
	* Visual vocabulary Familiarize yourself with certain wireframe standards such as those for images, video, and drawing attention to certain areas. 
2. Logos & Branding
	* Logos will usually be represented the same way as images, a box with a "X" through it, and a text description inside. Grayscale or low Ô¨Ådelity logos may be placed in the wireframe for certain situations.
3. Color
	* Other than links possibly being colored differently, most color and visual design elements are left for the later visual design stage. 
4. Hierarchy
5. Links
	*  Links are represented most often as blue, underlined text. Links may also be a different color, keeping in line with a particular visual design direction.
6. Text 
7. Layout

HTML 5, the W3C's recently redoubled effort to shape the next generation of HTML, has, over the last year or so, taken on considerable momentum. We have simply run out of HTML elements and attributes with which to mark up more richly semantic documents. HTML suffers from a fundamental defect as a semantic markup language-its semantics are fixed, not extensible. Hundreds of thousands of developers use the class and id attributes of HTML to create more richly semantic markup. Many pages around the web use microformats to add more structured semantics than available in HTML's impoverished set of elements and attributes. How is HTML 5 addressing this issue? HTML 5 introduces a number of new elements. We'll start by posing the question: "Why are we inventing these new elements?" A reasonable answer would be: "Because HTML lacks semantic richness, and by adding these elements, we increase the semantic richness of HTML-that can't be bad, can it?". By adding these elements, we are addressing the need for greater semantic capability in HTML, but only within a narrow scope. No matter how many elements we bolt on, we will always think of more semantic goodness to add to HTML. 

Having added as many new elements as we like, we still won't have solved the problem. If adding elements to HTML is out of the question, at least within the parameters of this discussion, attributes are the other logical area of HTML to concentrate on. The microformats project demonstrated that the existing attributes of HTML are not sufficient, as a generalized mechanism, to extend the semantics of HTML. So, if we are to use attributes to help solve this problem, we need to come up with one or more new attributes. Most importantly, is introducing new attributes to HTML backward compatible? And if so, does it provide a workable mechanism for semantic extensibility in HTML? Let's invent a new attribute. As I've detailed in another article, HTML includes structural semantics, rhetorical semantics, role semantics, and other classes or categories of semantics. Hopefully, if nothing else, then it's clear that simply "Making up new elements" isn't a solution to how to increase the semantic capacity of HTML. Let's not rush into these decisions lightly-after all, with climate change we've saddled our grandkids with enough trouble as it is
