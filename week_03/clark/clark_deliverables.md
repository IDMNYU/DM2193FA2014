### Show & Tell
http://www.myspace.com
My show and tell this week is the old social networking site myspace. I wanted to showcase how much myspace has changed, for those who still
remember trying to figure out which of our top friends would go in our list and what song is our theme for the week. I still see Tom on some
people's friends' list but other than that myspace has gotten a makeover. I see more advertisements and artists looking for people to notice 
their work rather that teenagers complaining about having sooooooooooooo much homework over the weekend. This goes to show that just because a
website is launched, doesn't mean it stopped evolving or that it has to be that type of website forever. In fact even a dead social network
can get a facelift and become something much different.

### Reading Response

This article talks about how websites are created, not through the different ways of coding, but rather through the website's project process.
It felt weird going through this article as this semester I am taking Software Engineering, and in this course we are learning about the 
different processes that projects can go through and which life cycle models are best. Even in my Software Engineering course, I had always
thought about how a website would go through the same process that people can use to build a computer. I feel that this article really showed
how important each part of a project is, for instance most people don't think of creating a site map before they begin coding and it can 
really halt a project in the middle of development. I also think the author made a great point by including mock webpages as a part of the 
design aspect of a website, as many people just think of the design as actually sitting down and writing up code.

This diagram was both amazing and annoying to me. It was amazing as how it pointed out each aspect of the fake web page and put everything into 
context, especially if this person has never designed a website before and has no knowledge of what each part of a page should be called. The 
annoying part that I found was never in the diagram did it state that this isn't the whole way to create a wireframe. Yes, the name of the 
diagram was how to READ a wireframe but I felt that there should have been some sort of disclaimer for it to say that it is possible to see 
many other wireframes that will look different than the one shown. I know for most CS majors and software engineers this would seem like a no 
brainer, however I know some people who would definintely argue with me over how a wireframe would look from this diagram.
