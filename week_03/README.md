### Homework
* Continue work on your 3 recipe html documents
  * **Make sure the HTML markup is consistent across all three documents!**
    * Same tags, same class names!
  * Add the `<link>` tag we created in the first recipe to the `<head>` of each of the documents
    * Make sure your styles are applying correctly to all of the recipes!
  * Expand on the styles we started in class
    * Remember, no styling of elements, no styling with #ids!
    * Only use .class names for styling.
  * Commit them to your **Week 3** folder.
    * We already got this started in class, it should just work :)
  * Experiment with styles over the weekend coming to week 4. We ran out of time in class!
