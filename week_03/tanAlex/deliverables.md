### Show & Tell
<!-- * [Name](http://link-to-cool-thing) -->
For this week's show and tell, I have chosen the website www.stars.chromexperiments.com . This website was one
of Google's experiments to see what they could do using HTML5. The website was built around HTML5. It demonstrates how
amazing and powerful HTML5 is. The website is easy to use and simple. Even though it's simple, it is very
informative, with facts about 100,000 stars. The website is not very resource consuming too.
