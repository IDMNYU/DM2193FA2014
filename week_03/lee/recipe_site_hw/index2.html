        <h1>Un-Boiled Chicken</h1>
        <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the Red Junglefowl. As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 24 billion in 2003,[1] there are more chickens in the world than any other species of bird. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.</h2>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a very large pot with water, enough to cover the chicken completely. You want a LOT of water. An 8 quart pot at least is best for ONE chicken or about 3 pounds of parts WITH bones. I do NOT recommend for boneless chicken, as the heat will not be able to penetrate the big pile of meat at the bottom of the pot.).</li>
            <li>Do not put the chicken in yet.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Now put in the chicken.</li>
            <li>As soon as it STOPS boiling, take out the chicken.</li>
            <li>Return the water to a boil, then put the chicken back in and cover tightly.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat but leave the pot on the burner.</li>
            <li>Leave it untouched for exactly ONE HOUR.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from water.</li>
            <li>Let it cool just enough to handle, then debone your chicken.</li>
            <li>I've been making it this way for about 16 years now.</li>
            <li>You can use a whole chicken or parts.</li>
            <li>The large volume of water is important: I use a 15 quart stock pot, and do 2 chickens at one time.</li>
        </ol>
