### Reading Responses

I cannot stress enough the importance of process in building digital products.  I don't mean that in a draconian way-- there are certainly individuals who become so focused on process that they forget to actually do work.  Based on my experience, it's extremely valuable to have predefined approaches to facilitate a (relatively) orderly development lifecycle.  At my company ([TENDIGI](http://www.tendigi.com)) we heavily rely on our issue tracker (JIRA) to track application features, bugs, and other assorted tasks. For example, a bug is not marked as "fully resolved" until it makes its way through a (hopefully objective) QA person who can confirm that the issue no longer occurs.  Upon approval, the changes to fix the bug are merged in to the project's main development branch and our continuous integration server automatically distributes a build to the client.  There are other processes (such as automated testing, unit and otherwise) that would probably  improve the autonomy of our day-to-day operations.  All-in-all, having a meaningful process (i.e. one that does not exist for its own sake) is an invaluable part of software development.
