			<p>
				Place beans and garlic in a food processor; pulse 5 times or until chopped. Add 1/2 cup water and remaining ingredients; pulse until smooth, scraping down sides as needed.
			</p>

			<p>	
				Feta-Baked Hummus: Combine Traditional Hummus, 1/2 cup (2 ounces) crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese, 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin. Transfer mixture to an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup (2 ounces) crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese. Bake at 400° for 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Garnish with parsley sprigs. Yield: 4 cups (serving size: about 2 tablespoons).
			</p>

			<p>
				White Bean and Roasted Garlic Hummus: Since this variation calls for roasted garlic, you can just omit the raw crushed garlic cloves from the Traditional Hummus. Remove white papery skin from 2 whole garlic heads (do not peel or separate the cloves). Wrap each head separately in foil. Bake at 350° for 1 hour; cool 10 minutes. Separate cloves; squeeze to extract garlic pulp. Discard skins. Place garlic pulp, Traditional Hummus, and 1 (15-ounce) can rinsed and drained cannellini beans (or other white beans) in a food processor; pulse 5 times or until chopped. Add 1/4 cup water; process until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Stir in 3/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary. Yield: 5 cups (serving size: about 2 1/2 tablespoons).
		</p>
		
			<p>
				Spicy Red Pepper Hummus: Cut 2 red bell peppers in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membranes. Place pepper halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet; flatten with hand. Broil 15 minutes or until blackened. Place in a zip-top plastic bag; seal. Let stand 10 minutes. Peel and cut into strips. Combine bell peppers, 2 teaspoons chile paste with garlic (such as sambal oelek), 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper in a food processor; pulse until smooth. Transfer pepper mixture to a serving bowl; stir in Traditional Hummus. Yield: 4 cups (serving size: about 2 tablespoons).
