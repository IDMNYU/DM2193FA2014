## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[Play Asteroids in the Browser](http://kickassapp.com/)
I chose this website because it is the perfect example of how javascript interacts with HTML elements, and to what crazy extend you can take this functionality (such as making a game out of it).  Bullets can actually destroy elements in a web page, dismantling the webpage as you progress in the game.  I chose this specific site because in the past there was a simple line of javascript you can paste into your address bar and turn ANY page into this game (showing the versatility of javascript), but I could not find a working version of this anymore (and plus it doesn't work with Google chrome's address bar because it also serves as a search box).
