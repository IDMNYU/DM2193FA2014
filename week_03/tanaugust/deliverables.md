## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/
This is a great site for video game related news. It's known for its use of sarcasm and oddball metaphors in it's articles. Each article contains a large thumbnail of the game it's about so it's easy to quickly scan over all the news to see if there's anything that interests you. The site focuses on PC games which is right up my alley. It also makes use of facebook, twitter, and reddit, allowing you to like/tweet/upvote an article directly from the site.

### Reading Responses
The first article, http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/22/following-a-web-design-process/, outlines the process that you should follow when making a website. It gives a step by step instruction with details. The process is planning, the design, development, launch, and post-launch. While the product is being made you have to make sure that you include documentation for your own team to follow and for the client to read.

The next article, http://blog.fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf, provides an explanation on how to read wireframes. It gives annotations on each part of a wireframe and describes the different kinds of text you can be reading.

The last article, http://alistapart.com/article/semanticsinhtml5, brings up some issues that have occurred with html in it's current development. It then uses these issues to highlight possible problems that may occur with html in the future. He reminds us that html is going to be around for a long time and that we want to come up with some standardization for it to avoid possible conflicts. Particularly, the author focuses on the new semantics that will be coming out for html and making sure that they are sensible.
