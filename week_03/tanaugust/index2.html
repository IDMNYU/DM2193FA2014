        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large zucchini</li>
            <li>1 extra-large egg white</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons almond meal</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter, ghee, or unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
        <ol>
        <li><p>Using either a hand-held grater or a food processor fitted with the shredding blade, shred the zucchini.</p></li>

        <li><p>Place the shredded zucchini in the center of a large, clean kitchen towel. Bring the sides up and twist hard to express all of the liquid. You may have to do this a few times to get all the liquid out; the drier the zucchini, the crisper the pancakes will be.</p></li>

        <li><p>Place the shredded, drained zucchini in a large mixing bowl. Add the egg white, almond meal, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing to blend in the seasonings.</p></li>

        <li><p>Heat the clarified butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. When very hot but not smoking, spoon in the zucchini mixture to make individual circles about 3-1/2 inches in diameter (you will need to do this in batches). Fry, turning once, until cooked through, golden brown, and crisp, about 5 minutes.</p></li>

        <li><p>Using a spatula, transfer to a double layer of paper towels to drain. If necessary, place on a baking sheet in a low oven to keep warm until ready to serve.</p></li>
