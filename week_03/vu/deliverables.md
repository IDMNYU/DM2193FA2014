## Week 2 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[Witcher 3](http://thewitcher.com/witcher3/#home) this website has a clear heirarchy and layout for a gaming website. Witcher 3 is a classic RPG game that will be coming out next year. The website looks awesome with the game graphics. When you type thewitcher.com/witcher3, it shows you the game trailer and it looks astounding.

### Reading Response
[Following a Web Design Process](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/22/following-a-web-design-process/) was an interesting read for those who plan on freelancing in the web development world. It's a good setup for those who are stuck on developing websites in general. Everything you make needs a good outline from planning to executing to finishing touches. I liked how Luke emphasized the need for documentation and refinement. The resource links were helpful too!

[How To Read A WireFrame](http://blog.fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf) made wireframes so much simpler! They break wireframes down nicely in 7 simple steps. It's definitely something to keep in mind when planning a website.

In [Semantics in HTML 5](http://alistapart.com/article/semanticsinhtml5) John Allsopp brought up interesting point about the semantics in HTML5. It's true that browser compatibility is a pain when it comes to CSS and HTML. THe worst is probably IE in general.. darn microsoft. I think that HTML should be extensible rather than creating more vocabulary and phrases just for the sake of one browser to accept it. HTML should extend to the future rather than having additions to an already lagging language.
