	<h3 class = "recipe-subheading">Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class = "ingredient">1 lb Oreo cookies (3 sleeves)</li>

			<li class = "ingredient">8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</li>

			<li class = "ingredient">1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

			<li class = "ingredient">1 lb milk chocolate</li>

			<li class = "ingredient">1/2 lb white chocolate</li>

		</ul>
	<br>
	<h3 class = "recipe-subheading">Directions</h3>
		<ol class = "instructions">
			<li class = "instruction">Using a food processor, grind cookies to a fine powder. With a mixer, blend cookie powder, cream cheese and vanilla extract until thoroughly mixed (there should be no white traces of cream cheese).</li>


			<li class = "instruction">Roll into small balls and place on wax-lined cookie sheet. Refrigerate for 45 minutes.</li>


			<li class = "instruction">Line two cookie sheets with wax paper. In double-boiler, melt milk chocolate. Dip balls and coat thoroughly. With slotted spoon, lift balls out of chocolate and let excess chocolate drip off. Place on wax-paper-lined cookie sheet.</li>


			<li class = "instruction">In separate double boiler, melt white chocolate. Using a fork, drizzle white chocolate over balls. Let cool.</li>

			<li class = "instruction">Store in airtight container, in refrigerator.</li>

			<li class = "instruction">Note: When I am exceedingly lazy (most often the case these days), I forego the chocolate 'dip' and merely roll my truffles into various mixtures - chopped nuts, chocolate sprinkles, vari-coloured candy sprinkles, cocoa powder, chocolate shavings, coloured sugars -- still pretty -- less work.</li>
