It appears most websites have issues with the infamous Internet Explorer â€“ make sure things work in all browsers, including IE.

Wireframes are used to show the setup of a webpage, and are the most basic examples of what the page will eventually look like. Essentially, they are to show the client the general layout, and color, text, images, etc will be added into later versions of the page.

HTML, though it is the most basic of web development tools, will probably be around for a while. Too many things are based off of it, and too much effort has been placed into it, for it to disappear entirely.

Backwards compatibility is important. (Also forward compatible.)

Web developers need more options for design in HTML.

Class/ID tags are being used to extend the creativity features of HTML.
