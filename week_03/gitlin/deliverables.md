## Week 3 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
* [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/)
I chose this website because its full of really useful web resources. It not only gives the code resources, but live demos of what the code does. Another really cool thing is that contributers explain their inspiration for whatever they submit.

### Reading Responses
* [Following a Web Design Process](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/22/following-a-web-design-process/)
* [How to Read a Wireframe](http://blog.fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf)
* [Semantics in HTML5](http://alistapart.com/article/semanticsinhtml5)

This weeks articles all cover essential things about website development, more importantly about planning and building a website based on that plan. Making wireframes is an amazing way to plan the layout of a website without putting momumental effort into the actual design of elements (styles and such). Since wireframes are a very commonly used tool, knowing how to read them is crucial. Once you have a wireframe you need to go about writing the markup for the website. This is where the semantics come in. You need to write a website that makes use of as many new and improved elements that new versions of HTML have to offer, but you also have to keep in mind backwards compatibility. These articles really make you think about how you go about making any website you work on, in order to have it designed in a pleasing way, as well as work as best as possible on as many devices as possible.
