	It is a website of a hotel. I choosed it because it is simple, clear links to each pages, and it has a built in program for booking
It has galleries, and pages of introduction. simple and easy to use, but works great as a small hotel website. 
But although it is so simple, things never works. I have no idea how they build a simple and unstable web.

#### Example
[Yugop](http://yugop.com)
Yugop reminds me of 2003 when the Internet was a weird wasteland of no more than the occasional experimental burst of bright white light 
hinting of a future to come, rich with interactive design, thoughtful user experience, and relentless amounts of media information and context!

The article talks about something thats related to the two we read. First is connetion. we now using web to connect everything together.
When we have so much things, we need special people, thats how the article says, in the one I am reading, it saying that in the future the website will be more open. I guess something similar to Wiki or Github where we can let people work together instead of specialist. 
At the same time we have a risk, some of the tool or language we will use wil lmake this no longer works for speicalist anymore so ---
we can all use it. But professionals also means rules and limitation, we set things in a same formate, but when everyone without learn 
to follow the rule is impossible.
