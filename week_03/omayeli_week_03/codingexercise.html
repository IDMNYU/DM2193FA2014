		<h2 id = "About"> About the organization.</h2>
		<p> <abbr title="Cats are evil">CAE</abbr> is an organization run by people across the world in their homes that aims to shed light on the <strong>inherent</strong> evilness of cats. What do we mean exactly? <dfn>Evil</dfn> means "morally wrong or bad; immoral; wicked." (Reference: <cite><a href = "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/evil" rel = "external"> dictionary.com </a>)I mean someone must have to want to kill them a lot for God to have given them 9 lives right? Anyways, cats are evil. We need people to know that.

		<h2 id ="Aim"> How we do it. </h2>
		<p> We depend largely on the internet and word of mouth. Ocassionally some of us walk outside and talk to people about our experiences with cats and why any other animal (literally any other animal) would make a better pet and companion than a cat. </p>
