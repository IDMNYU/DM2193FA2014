### Show & Tell
[Showcase Commercial Type](http://showcase.commercialtype.com/)
Features designs for 16 microsites that each show a different font family from a library and "highlight a different aspect of its personality." The font microsites are interactive and engaging and feature fonts in a variety of instances == whether conversation or animation.

* [Following a Web Design Process](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/22/following-a-web-design-process/)
I thought the article was very informative and cool -- the list of resources is really helpful. It reminded me that what we're (trying) to do isn't strictly one-sided. There are other things to think about rather than our own vision namely the client, target audience e.t.c. Also, I like that it acknowledged that "the process will be different for each designer/project." It's something I think I'd try to follow without fail but in the end I think I'd fall back into disorganization. We'll see. Kudos to the people that can do this for every project though.

* [Semantics in HTML 5](http://alistapart.com/article/semanticsinhtml5)
Fav quote: "Let’s not rush into these decisions lightly—after all, with climate change we’ve saddled our grandkids with enough trouble as it is. Let’s at least leave them the best possible HTML we can."
HTML isn't going anywhere soon and I do agree with the author pretty much on everything he said. While at the back of my mind I'm thinking we could just wing it (forever) and who even uses IE6/IE7 anymore?? it's important to cater to all browsers and readers and responsibly find a way to make HTML better. The additions on HTML5 while an improvement (e.g section to group content and time) it's not a feasible solution. We can't just keep adding elements whenever we see a need for something. We'll end up with a billion elements half of which cannot show on a percentage of browsers. I like his recommendation (the class names) -- using what is already there just in a more specific and different way. But it begs the question how (if we are to) create a standard and make it normal practice.
lass values, or should the possible values all be determined by a standardized specification?
