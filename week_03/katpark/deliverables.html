*Reading Response

On a general note, I find it interesting that there is an increasing debate about (art) in different professions or subjects. There seems to be a newfound need to attribute work, especially technology, with art. For many,however, art is strictly understood in terms of an object's aesthetic qualities. 

I really enjoyed Luke's article, because he speaks specifically about the importance of visual perception. Though his article speaks about techniques that would increase an audience's interest-placement,color,weight,etc.- I think, he's getting at a more important idea. In a sense, he is illustrating the fact that what we see on surface level, has agency over how we process ideas and thoughts. The analogy that comes to mind is: visual display is like a hook in an essay; it has the ability to drawn an audience in and keep them captivated, or deter them from continuing on.
