        <h2>What the hell is it?</h2>

       In Twin Peaks, garmonbozia is pain and sorrow, manifested as a substance resembling cream of corn soup for the spirits that feed on it in the White Lodge/Black Lodge. This is according to the little man, who may well be the other arm of the one-armed man.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

				<li>5 cans creamed corn</li>
				<li>1/5th of vodka, the cheaper the better</li>
				<li> emulsifier </li>
				<li> horseradish</li>
				<li> Campari to taste</li>
				<li> a dash of bleach</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 100000F.</h3>
<h3>COMBINE </h3> <p> Stir all the ingredients together, preferably with a wooden spoon that has been dropped in the toilet. Slurp it backwards or, if this isn't possible, pour into a large glass and chug. As you run screaming to the closest wastebasket, sink, or toilet, contemplate what "pain and sorrow" means to you. </p>
