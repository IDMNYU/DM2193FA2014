## Final Deliverables
I'm doing a writing theme for my blog. It will be very simple, I'm trying to style it after the layout of a book (and of some libraries) but there will be (hopefully) some animation that you cannot get in books and some fluid interactions just to make it more seamless and natural. The cover page will have an image like the cover of a book and details about the blog and the author. Then you can scroll to see the contents table (recent posts) and then archives. The post page will have the posts of course, will be continously scrolling until you reach the end where there will be an arrow button to the next post. The title of the blog, the image (for the post) and a tiny menu navigation bar will be fixed as the user scrolls. It only supports text posts.
