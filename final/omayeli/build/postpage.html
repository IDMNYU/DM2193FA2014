         <p>She plopped her head back on the seat of the car and just breathed for a moment before putting the key in the ignition. She ran her weary fingers through her tiny flecks of grey hair and rested it on her lap. When she turned it over, there were tiny strands suffocating between her fingers. One strand in particular found its place right on top of the depression on her ring finger. She rubbed over it with her other hand. She sighed. It had been a long day. She had arrived at 8am that morning, a bag full of reports in one hand and a bundle of regret in the other, in the form of a planner. Each session had lasted about 30 minutes. Mrs. Kingsley had gone on and on about how smart her daughter was and how it was a shame, just a shame that it didn’t reflect in her grades. “Just a shame,” she repeated almost four times – each time the plea in her face becoming more and more apparent. After that she spent the next hour comforting Miss. Cecilia when the subject of her son’s fascination with the underlining of an assistant teacher’s skirts was brought to the table. More and more parents faded in and faded out throughout the day – their faces and voices slowly becoming just traces of memory as she drove along the wet road.
        <p> “You can come in now!” she tried to shout to the next pair; politely smiling to the others that were passing by. </p>
        <p> He was looking at a collage of pictures on the board. He hadn’t heard her. She stepped out of the room. “Mister, mister…” she called out. He turned to face her. She stood silent for a couple of seconds astounded by how young he looked. He stretched out his hand to meet hers. “Excuse me?” he said. She snapped out of her reverie.</p>
        <p> “Oh my! I’m sorry,” she gasped, finally stretching her hand out to shake it. “It’s alright,” he replied, a faint smile stretching across his face. She blushed. He smiled again. “Um, is your child here? …Actually, who is your child? …Sorry I don’t have my list with me,” she said, her hands fumbling around her pockets. “Oh she’s – There she is!” he said reaching his hand over to her. The young girl walked forward slowly and stood next to her father. She didn’t say a word. “Oh, oh... Um, this, this is your daughter sir?” </p>
          <p>“Yes, I’m Sadie’s dad” he replied. Sadie stood silently. “I thought you said mom was coming Sadie,” The teacher remarked softly. Sadie didn’t reply. She just looked at the floor as if she hadn’t heard the question. “Hope there’s no problem. Her mom had to pick up an extra shift at work today, so she told me to come. “Anyway I’d love to see how my dear Sadie is holding up,” he said, lifting his eyes to hers to reveal a wide grin. She blushed again. </p>
            <p>“Yes, I mean no, of course not. Come in,” she said, holding the door open. “Sadie can stay in the waiting room with all the other kids.” He planted a kiss on Sadie’s cheek and then whispered, his fingers clutching her shoulders, “I love you, honey.”</p> 
         <p>You know I love you, honey. I won’t do anything.” He wiped a handkerchief over his brow. He was sweating profusely. She was sitting at the back of the car, her hands folded across her chest. She didn’t say anything. “I just need to know if you told anyone?” he repeated. “Sadie, answer me.” She turned her face away. “Sadie…Sadie,” he said, this time more softly. “I need to know if you told someone. Did you tell anyone?” He unbuckled his seatbelt and turned towards her. “Sadie, I told you I was sorry.” He ran his hands through his short brown hair. “Sadie, I just need you to tell me if you told anyone.” She didn’t respond. “Sadie, your mom isn’t going to be very happy if she finds out. You don’t want that do you?” Slowly, he took the key out of the ignition and then moved to the back of the car. He took the seat next to her and watched as the tears formed lines along her cheek. She still remained quiet. “Dammit Sadie tell me!” he shouted, throwing his head back. Then suddenly rushed forward and punched the window of his car. </p> <p> “So how do these things work?” he asked making himself comfortable. “Well, we’ll go over her reports and then talk about how to make sure Sadie gets the most out of being here,” she replied, taking a seat in front of him. She reached for her bag of reports at the side of her chair and he caught her hand midway. She jumped. “I really appreciate what you’re doing for my daughter,” he said, looking into her eyes. She blushed then as she did in her car as she turned into her driveway. “It’s not a problem,” she said had finally said. He grinned again and rested back into his seat. They talked for a little bit about her reports. She told him that Sadie was consistently the highest scorer in their exercises – although, as she said, she wasn’t supposed to. It evokes a sense of competition among parents, she remembered the principal saying. He responded by smiling and placing his index finger over his mouth. “Your secret is safe with me,” he said, smiling again. They both laughed. “The thing is, there’s been a change in her,” her teacher started after she stopped laughing. He turned his face and looked at her somberly as if to say I know. She continued, “Her grades are lower – not low enough to invoke action but to bring up concern. And that’s not even it…she’s been…different.” She looked directly towards him to see if he would say something. He was quiet. “Yeah,” he finally said. “I’ve been kind of worried too. Things at home are not as great as they should be.” He got up and walked to the board filled with all the students. “How do you mean?” the teacher answered, walking towards him. “Just, her mom has been away a lot lately and she really misses her. She’s started…” “What?” “Acting out. She breaks plates, throws tantrums, really anything to get her mother’s attention. I wish she could spend more time with us but we lost a lot over the past few years. I lost my job. I can’t seem to find a new one. Everything has just…gone to shit,” he finished, bumping his fist tenderly on the wall. </p>
        <p> “You shouldn’t blame yourself,” she said softly stopping inches from his back, resisting the urge to put her hand on his shoulder. He turned to face her. His 6-foot frame towered over her. She looked up at his faint blue eyes and felt something begin to stir. Sadie’s mother was beautiful. She had short black hair that exposed her lithe neck and one of her piercing blue eyes.</p></section>
