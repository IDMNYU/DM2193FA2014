Goal

In terms of design, I would like my page to be black and white so that it looks relatively clean, but I also want the backround of the page to include chaotic black and white art in order to contrast the theme of clarity. I included conceptual photography as the center image for now (just because I'm obsessed with conceptual photography). I was thinking that, unlike Tumblr, the scroll would affect the center image by changing it infinitely without an apparent scroll bar. While the picture changes, I was thinking that I could make the words in the background scroll up and down as well, spitting out randomn inspirational words. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to do this yet...but I'm looking for some websites that have similar concepts and example codes.
