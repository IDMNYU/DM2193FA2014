[Classical Inheritance in JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com/inheritance.html)

Response + Find a simpler version of this explanation!

I agree with you that this explanation was way too complicated ! 
The thing is it's written for people who already know C++ or Java. 
Even though I took Java last semester, I honestly found this so confusing
I couldn't even finish reading it, lol. 

Instead I found an awesome youtube video of this awesome Indian guy explaining w/ awesome neon colors and everything! 

Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFWvIEVZ_j8 

He doesn't get into too much detail and focuses on explaining the simple notion
that when an there is a chain of objects and their prototypes, the properties of the object (b) made from the prototype (a) will inherit the properties of the prototype (a) and when making a new object (c) from that second object (b), the properties of the object (b) will override the properties of the initial 
prototype (a).
