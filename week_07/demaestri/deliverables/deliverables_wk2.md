So in this website you can make a color based on changing the RGB scales and it’s just visually a very cool way of displaying this. And then it’s also awesome that they give you the exact hex number for the color, so it’s create for web designers. 

### Reading Responses 

So when it comes to the question of whether or not software engineering and coding should be considered craftsmanship, I would say with no doubt. I would even go as far as calling it art, no matter where or why or how you are coding. Creation involves making something new based off of creativity and intuition and skill. I feel that any and all creation is art and coding is obviously a form of creation. There you go, that's my schpeel. 

### Coding Exercise
