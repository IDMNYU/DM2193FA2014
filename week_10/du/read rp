Read over the doman thing, I have a friend already have some, I may buy one under my own name first and see if i need more. 

I guess this is what people called, this code looks nice, clean or even beautiful although i cant see the beauty of it but it does make things easier. ( I thought sublinetext could do the layer by itself or maybe there is a tool?)

The way of make everything shorter is great, but it just make someone who never write any code before think things are complex. for sure it is a fast and a useful way, but the question is when forgot close or some other error is there, is the subline text will provide the same help just like html? or browser may not beable to get the error reason cause there is not a normal functional tag or direct?
