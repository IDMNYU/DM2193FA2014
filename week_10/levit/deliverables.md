How to Get Started With Web Design:
I've only recently started hosting my own website, after the creation of a company I started with a couple friends. We run an MSP so I needed a website that looked professional and clean, and well, I definitely don't have the skills yet to create something quite so pretty as I needed, so I chose to use a template. If I had months to work on it, maybe I could've created something sort of comparable, but as it goes, web design takes many weeks of planning and coding to get to a point where a website is functional and beautiful enough to work for what you need. As it is, Porto was the creator of the template for my website, but I had the overall control of the final product and orientation of the parts of the website.
