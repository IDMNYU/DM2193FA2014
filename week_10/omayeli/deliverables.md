## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
* [Code Beautify] (http://codebeautify.org/javaviewer)
	Make your code look pretty! (Useful for documentation, sharing code)

### Reading Responses
* [How to get started in Web Design, Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/get-started-web-design/)
	I think people already have stumbling blocks before they learn how to do something so with that in mind I'm not really crazy about them saying getting started involves buying a website and spending money. I think it should be titled "How to get a website online." Getting started in web design is just as easy as typing a heading into html and then opening it up in google chrome
* [Harry, The Specificity Graph](http://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/)
	I thought the article was interesting. Obviously, the sites I've made are not at the level yet where specificity would become a big problem when doing maintenance but I think it was very helpful -- the shape of what css specificity should look like makes a lot of sense to me and I believe helps workflow and just accessing styles (you don't have to scroll for 8 minutes looking for a class throughout the document cause you know they come after the type selectors)
* [Fun with Named Functions in Javascript](http://raganwald.com/2014/10/24/fun-with-named-functions.html)
	Javascipt still confuses me a bit so I'm not sure I absorbed/understood as much as I would have liked to from this article. (I guess that's telling me I need to read more.)
