## Weekly Deliverables

### Show & Tell
* [Code Beautify] (http://codebeautify.org/javaviewer)
	Make your code look pretty! (Useful for documentation, sharing code)

### Reading Responses
* [How to get started in Web Design, Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/get-started-web-design/)
	I think people already have stumbling blocks before they learn how to do something so with that in mind I'm not really crazy about them saying getting started involves buying a website and spending money. I think it should be titled "How to get a website online." Getting started in web design is just as easy as typing a heading into html and then opening it up in google chrome
* [Harry, The Specificity Graph](http://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/)
* [Fun with Named Functions in Javascript](http://raganwald.com/2014/10/24/fun-with-named-functions.html)
