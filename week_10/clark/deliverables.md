### Show & Tell

Best website for when you have no idea what you should make for dinner. Even if you don't like what they give you, you can keep clicking for a 
new recipe until you finally stumble upon something you really like. They even have an option for those who don't eat meat, and if you're not
in the mood to check the website everyday for what you want to eat, there is a cookbook that you can purchase and keep to always flip through
for every meal if you're really that indecisive. 

### Reading Responses

I hate no idea that this website existed and I'm really upset that we weren't given it earlier to look at. I feel as though this website isn't 
for people who have never touch HTML or CSS before, however it is an amazing source for how to advance your skills. For my midterm project, the
hardest part, besides making the layouts for all my items work, was creating a drop-down menu. I feel that by further exploring this website, 
especially the videos, then I can be able to work it out.

This is another article that I wish I read before starting my midterm. This article following the architecture and flow of how CSS lays out 
items, SPECIALLY how you want it to be mapped out, which is exactly what I have been having so many issues. While I understand having the 
different positions, and creating blocks vs inline and so on, I need work on figuring out the exact combination of what needs to be done in 
CSS to get the specific design that I want from when I worked on my wireframes and designs. As a CS major, I have coded for almost 3 years now
and CSS has to be one of the difficult languages to get to do EXACTLY what you want it. Specification is so important to CSS but it is 
difficult to figure out when to code such specifics and figuring out how to get your amazing designs to real code.

This article was a great refresh for functions in general and is a great help for those who aren't used to functions and classes as a Junior in
CS might be. I liked this article as it showed step by step how functions can become more complicated and how variables can work inside and 
outside of functions. It also is helpful in terms of showing the syntax that is needed, as each language has a different set of syntax to make a function. Most languages are similar in just creating a function name and then working within the function, where as in HTML you need to specify that what you are creating is indeed a function and that everything must be within the barracks of the function.
