Nearly everything in all three of these articles went straight over my head, and I feel the only way I'm ever going to learn/understand any of web design/hositng is if I'm forced into doing it myself. Though I did bookmark the domain name/server space page. That one seems quite useful for the future. If I ever run into a point in my life when I need step-by-step instructions in getting a webpage on the internet, and I ever manage to remember that it's in my bookmarks, then great.
