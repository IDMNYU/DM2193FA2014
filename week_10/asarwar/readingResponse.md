[The Specificity Graph](http://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/)
--

Specificity is is one of CSS' most troublesome features, and is an area that soon becomes hard to manage on projects of any reasonable size.

Specificity is a trait best avoided, which is why we don't use IDs in CSS, and we don't nest selectors unless absolutely necessary. 
We can't avoid specificity completely: there are types of selector that we have to use on projects that are inherently more or less specific than others.
The Specificity Graph is something I have only been speaking about recently, and is a cornerstone of my currently unpublished architecture.
Its aim is to give a very broad and general overview of the specificity of selectors across an entire project.

The Specificity Graph works by taking a look at your entire project's CSS, and plotting the specificity of all of its selectors on a simple line graph.
On the x axis we plot Location in Stylesheet and on the y axis we plot the specificity of that selector.

You can very roughly plot your own Specificity Graph by taking a look at your codebase at a very high level.
A peak represents a selector of a relatively high specificity, and occurs before a selector of a lower specificity.
A graph with a lot of peaks and troughs is a bad Specificity Graph: it is telling us that our CSS is full of-or prone to-specificity issues because of weighty selectors being defined before lighter ones.

We have a codebase that is likely to prove problematic because we have erratic and poorly managed specificity-and-source-order: we are more likely to spend time undoing or negating the effects of high specificity CSS that was defined too early in the project.
It's all well and good knowing what our Specificity Graph currently looks like, but what should it look like? Well, if we know we want to avoid peaks and troughs, we could presume that we want a flat graph: a flat graph means no specificity wars because there are no valleys to leave or mountains to overcome.

The issue there is that it's impossible to have a perfectly flat line because there will always be some selectors that are of a lower or higher specificity than others.
In general we do want to keep specificity low at all costs, but any unavoidable specificity we introduce needs taking care of appropriately.
An upward trending Specificity Graph represents CSS that is, essentially, written in specificity order.

We start with low specificity selectors at the beginning of the project, followed up by type selectors, followed up by class-based component selectors and finally ending with our overrides and helper classes.
Including these types of rule early on in a project produces a huge spike in the Specificity Graph right near the beginning, setting the bar very high for subsequent work.
Move all utility and helper classes to the very end of your CSS in order to introduce a spike right at the end, meaning you're far less likely to have to undo or override high specificity selectors in your subsequent work.

Always try to maintain an upward trending Specificity Graph across your projects.

[Fun with Named Functions in JavaScript](http://raganwald.com/2014/10/24/fun-with-named-functions.html)
--

A named function is a function declaration if it appears as a statement.

The function rank is defined in the function declaration function rank.
Declaring a named function binds the function to the name in its surrounding environment.
That's why we can use the function rank within the function officer.

Is function an expression or a declaration? Is function surname an expression or a declaration?
The answers are 1: function is always an expression, but 2: function surname can be an expression or a declaration, depending on how you use it.

We've used function family as an expression here, and bound the value to the name surname just as we did with an anonymous function.
When we declare a function, its name is bound in the enclosing environment, but when we use the function as an expression, its name is not bound in the enclosing environment.

Here's a named function expression: function even.
We're making a "Constructor" function, old-school style, and we're using properties of the constructor function as the rough equivalent of "Class variables" in other languages.

Named functions can be either declared in a statement or used in an expression.
