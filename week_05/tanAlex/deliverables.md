### Show & Tell
<!-- * [Name](http://link-to-cool-thing) -->
For this week's show & tell, the website is www.incredibox.com. The website allows the user to create music using a list of beats, melodies, effects, and voices available. The user can mix and match the different sounds to his or her liking. The different sounds are visually represented as articles of clothing on a person. There are different versions with different sounds. The website also unlocks specific videos if the user is able to make certain combinations. The website uses javascript with a very simple interface and design.
