## Week 10 Deliverables

### Show & Tell
[Witcher 3](http://thewitcher.com/witcher3/#home) this website has a clear heirarchy and layout for a gaming website. Witcher 3 is a classic RPG game that will be coming out next year. The website looks awesome with the game graphics. When you type thewitcher.com/witcher3, it shows you the game trailer and it looks astounding.

### Reading Response
[Get Started on Web Design](http://css-tricks.com/get-started-web-design/) 
	I actually looked at this website earlier this year when one of my friends wanted to make his own website. I sent him this link and it made making websites much easier than it actually is.

[Specificity Graph](http://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/) 
	I feel like with the specificity graph, it takes a lot of practice to achieve that perfect linear location in speicificty. But, it would be perfect if such a trend existed in most, if not all stylesheets.

In [Fun with Named Functions](http://raganwald.com/2014/10/24/fun-with-named-functions.html) 
	This is pretty much what we learned in intro to pgramming, where you learn scope and naming of functions. It's a good and fun read when you're learning coding for the first time. Plus, it gives a peek at javscript syntax.
